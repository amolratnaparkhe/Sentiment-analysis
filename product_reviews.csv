                I already subscribed ¬£10 for a month and when i tried to call it‚Äôs says i have no credit, i kept calling and also searching online why i need to pay another credit. They don‚Äôt give that much clarification why i need to pay credit. My friend recommended this app to me but i regret it that I install this app. Anyway i paid another ¬£5 of credit.<br>I thought that‚Äôs it i have my unlimited call for 1 month. But NOO!!! Not even half an hour talking to my family in other country it ended up my call and saying i need top up again cause i have no credit!  Nothing worse than this.  I removed my card details i dont want to continue. My ¬£15 didn‚Äôt last that long. Im sorry but i wasn‚Äôt happy.

                They never ever contact me back, ever!!!, there is no phone numbers to call ether so all you can do is send an email and hope for the best, I have send them 3 email already and nothing, the offers for recharging to Cuba never get to my family in Cuba, and like I said I have contacted Rebtel about it  and nothing.

                The company is dishonest.  Even though the original fee is minimal, the calls must be reactivated from minute to minute after reloading. The fees are relatively high.  There are many bugs and problems

5 stars: Excellent,"<p class=""review-content__text"">
                So far so good, used the free trial, and now am on Global monthly pay, only down side is their website, they do not have proper customer service, you have to email them and wait for a response, which is generally not straight to the point.It would have been netter if they  had an online chat. But also to mention i needed customer service only during the free trial, now its ok. One can cancel online the account at any time if they are not satisfied, thats a good thing.<br>Phone quality and connectivity to India is good. I am in the UK, and can also use it for local calls  too. Please note to use this service you should have local minutes too, otheerwise it will not work.

                Needed to call overseas to a bank &amp; it worked! Great, especially if you have to wait for goodness knows how long through the call-centers... it could be $100+++ but instead you just pay a nice flat fee of $5 upfront (or something like that) :) My call did drop twice over wifi which was annoying but it could've been my own router &amp; overall it gets the job done very well...!!!

                If I there was an option to choose zero stars, that's what I would have chosen! The Cuba Welcome Offer 20 min is definitely a scam -DON'T FALL FOR IT! It shows in my account under ""Account Activity"" that I have paid the $5.00 charge for a 20-minute call to Cuba but then I can't use it!!! Every time I try to make a call to Cuba, I get the message 'You're out of credit""!!! And you can't get any Customer Support. I have sent 2 emails and no reply received. Absolutely no chance of talking to Customer Service or even just chatting with an agent!

                I signed my Mom up so that she can call her family in Colombia after several failed attempts and extremely poor customer service, I deactivated Global Unlimited for $ 10 monthly before they actually charged. When I receive my Credit Card statement, I see six charges for $10 each plus my bank stated that Rebtel was trying to use my card for a purchase! Be careful they steal your card information.

                My sister-in-law told me about this. It's so simple. You add what minutes you want and that's it. I don't have to pay a monthly service for international calls that I won't be using on a daily or even weekly basis. This gives me the freedom to control what minutes I use and I think that's what makes it a great service. The set up was simple to follow and the connection is great. I call American Samoa from this app. I am so glad I found it. Makes things so much simple.

I think you guys should hire a good programmer or developer. Your website is not friendly to use. I got a hard time loading my payment from your website. Fortunately, your customer support are very nice and they helped me in any way they can. They go far to solve my issues and they escalate my problem very quick. Thanks to Ryan he deserve a salary raise. Thank you!

                Even though I still use rebel on emergency calls. I'm annoyed by the fact that they will call you from a cloned number of your contact when they want you to buy more credit. The first time they did it I fell for they trap and actually went and bought airtime to call my loved one who were shocked to hear I was calling to return their missed call. It was confusing until they actually did it on the different occasions when I was already on the phone with the number they had cloned. This a deceptive way of doing business.

                For those who wish to refer friends for the referral bonus should be alert.   <br>They add up the bonus with my previous top balance in a lump sum total.   However, when I tried to use it to buy the subscription, they told me the credit balance couldn't be transferred or converted into other subscription.  I asked for the reason since I couldn't see this condition display in the website.   It seems they gave me their internal document as I couldn't find any information in the help search either. I am not happy about this as there is no information clearly related to the invite friends until I asked about this.  Also, it limits our choice to use the credit balance as has been earned through referral business to Rebtel.  Rebtel should review on this.

                Rebtel, in my short experience, is one of those companies where you are CERTAIN that a good deal of the time at business meetings is spent asking  how they can do even BETTER than 'Great!'. Everything is easy, logical, sensible, uncomplicated... the quality of the calls I've made has been like talking to someone next door, and the pricing seems reasonable and is very transparent. Everything about the site design and the app itself just is clean and basic but functionally attractive. ON THE OTHER HAND, stay MILES away from Tel3!! I'm just warning you, that site is deadly if you have a problem! Tech support on Rebtel is ridiculously friendly and even warm, very, very responsive and goes above and beyond. Thank you for Rebtel!

                The worst service I‚Äôve ever had. They took my unused money off claiming that the offer ‚Äúexpired‚Äù 72 hours after the purchase was done!! Request #2059182. I do not recommend this company, they don‚Äôt have a real customer service!! If you are looking for a company to make international calls you better think of a local company, not a company abroad that doesn‚Äôt respect and value a client!! Now I have to dispute my money ($30) through my credit card company, forget about Maja, Mark Louie or any other ‚Äúagent‚Äù, they are gonna waste your time!!!

                Rebtel is amazing, I‚Äôve been using Rebtel for probably over 5-7 years. Very easy to use and set up, cost effective, sometimes I add ¬£7 but this lasts for a good 3-4 months sometimes even long as 6months (obviously depending on your usage) I make frequent calls abroad to my parents.<br>The other great feature they have is if you send the link to a friend and they join then you automatically get a top up too.

                They should get no star if an option. I removed their app from my phone and deleted my credit card # from their auto charge in 2019. They acknowledged my cc was removed in 2019 and yet I was charged in April 2020 for service I wasn't even near Using. I kept emailing them to have their IT checked out from what # the calls werre made from and to check their records and give me my money back. They refused to do do and yet today I got an email saying ‚Äú your service is restricted‚Äù what service????? You already acknowledged I discontinued service back in 2019 but you managed to retrieve a card I removed from authorization. This company is ripping people. Im about to report them to BBB and RIP OFF. COM. If they dont fix soon.

                Yooo! Funny that on 2020 they haven't come up with negative star ratings. Some companies deserve them actually, and Rebtel is one of them.<br>Stay away from this company. They will not only lose you money, but will make you lose your patience as well.<br><br>Big shout out to Customer Support.<br>They come up with the most idiotic questions and answers most of the time and they don't even do they job properly so you have to repeat your self...for ever!<br>Still, nothing personal, I bet they(the staff) get paid with cigarettes and plastic pearls, that might be the reason they care so much about their job. <br>Their names are not even real. A company that provides ""VOIP communication services &amp; international calls"" services and they don't even have a phone line customer support? Well we all know that's a classic from low quality to scamming services.<br><br>A team with a great imagination tho...but on how to take your money with out doing any job or providing actual service that they highly advertise.<br><br>Stay away from them, unless you would like to acknowledge them as a charity and give them money for free.

                Rabtel will never disappoint you because even the small issue I got after making 500 calls successful the one issue of a call connecting and the other person I was calling maybe his network was not good ,when I complained to Rabtel that my money was deducted but I didn't had a clear conversation, Rabtel paid me back more minutes for free with out charge

                Hi, i am really disappointed from rebtel now a days. I got top up10$per month  on 2 March for india unlimited calls but on 6 march my call was disconnected. I checked my rebtel account thn i saw they provided me world credits instead of unlimited india calling top up. Tell me what was my fault. No helpline number of rebtel is working. No one reply.6 march to till now i am not able to do my international calls. Now i think i just did waste of time and money choosing rebtel. I sent email to rebtel support but i didn't get any solution for my problem. I spent my 10 dollar on rebtel still i am in problem.

                This is a terrible app. The first day I signed up and the call connected immediately. I was happy with the speed and clarity of connection. But I have never been able to connect to the Rebtel local number after. For 3 consecutive days every time I ring it has been coming busy, it‚Äôs unacceptable and I think a very cheap way of taking money off people. People like us download the app to connect to our families and this misguides us into believing that the service is easy to use.

                I am a new user to Rebtel. I was not sure when trying this out to call Pakistan. But after giving them a go i have found it very useful. Call charges are competitive however on certain calls the connection was poor, even when using the auto option within call connecting. But after trying again giving a small gap between attempts i managed to get a better connection. Not sure if the weather plays a part with the quality of the call. Overall, i am happy so far. The 4 stars is because of the hit and miss with call quality.

                I have left one review in Spanish.  Now I think Rebtel is a serious fraud.  It simply does not work.  The call quality is too poor to sustain a conversation.  Now I wish to cancel my account, I cannot even log in.  It just offers me the opportunity to call Ukraine!  They have my credit card number and are charging me.  Disgraceful!  Do not go anywhere near them.

Poi il telefono del ricevente inizia a squillare, e il credito continua a essere consumato anche se il ricevente non risponde; 10 squilli, altri 20 secondi (che, sommati ai 30 secondi dell'annuncio, fa 1 minuto di credito sottratto). <br>La chiamata si √® interrotta 3 volte, e per 3 volte mi √® stato sottratto 1 minuto di credito.<br>Quindi il costo effettivo della chiamata √® altissimo.<br>A seguito di questa recensione, sono stato contattato personalmente per approfondimenti; successivamente, mi √® stato rimborsato del credito telefonico.<br>Assolutamente corretti.<br><br>Before the connection I receive a voice message that indicates the credit and suggests a recharge: the time (about 30 seconds) is subtracted from my phone credit! Then the recipient's phone starts ringing, and the credit continues to be consumed even if the recipient does not answer; 10 rings, another 20 seconds (which, added to the 30 seconds of the announcement, makes 1 minute of credit subtracted).<br>The call ended 3 times, and 1 minute of credit was stolen 3 times.<br>So the real cost of the call is very high.<br>Following this review, I was personally contacted for further information; later, I was refunded for the phone credit.<br>Absolutely correct.

                I tried several different  calling apps and still was not a satisfactory for me because I needed to speak to my mom at anytime i want but those ones didn't have it. Is either I used them for a while and it starts to corrupt or its ends the call by itself in every 30 minutes so that I will call back. Rebtel is a different  one all together.  As long as you have credit then you good to go.clarty is woow. Thank you Rebtel

                I registered and used their Free Unlimited USA plan for several weeks with great service. Then all of a sudden, without warning, my access was blocked. I have tried to reach customer support via the Developer contact on Google Play, via email Support @ rebtel .com and using the HELP widget on their website. I can't even login to my account. Nothing has changed with regard to my mobile service or network. I made calls via Mobile Data and wifi only - never used a landline phone. For days the only reply is Rebtel's robo email with the same 4 questions that I have repeatilty answered, while I do not get any follow up or access to my restricted account. There is no phone number for me to reach a human to answer why my access was cut off when I need to reach my banks in the USA?

                I have spent some money buying internatio nal phone calls from Rebtel, but it's obvious day by day that it's all a scam. I just can make calls to few numbers, most of phone calls are automatically ended when the receiver pick up the phone. Every second is charged. Costumer services is a robot who gives the same answers to everybody, just check the reviews. Tryed hard to get along with you, but you tryed hard to take advantage of me.

                Appalling BE CAREFUL! They can switch you off at any time giving no explanation. Application is fine while it works. I was a rebtel customer for a long time. Now I lost services for 3 weeks. It took their customer service ages to figure out what's wrong as there is no phone support and the email responces are very slow. In the meanwhile I couldn't use their services what they charged me for. It turned out they banned my account with no explanation given! I was reading their terms and conditions and there is no way I breached them. services. Utterly shocked by this. I had unlimited call subscription and only called a handful of numbers on a weekly basis. This is the worst treatment I ever came accross and my biggest regret is that I actively promoted them to our local community recruiting several customers for them.  It is good while it works but than it turns to a nightmare.

                It was a great regret for downloading rebtel apps. I credited the application with ¬£5 to call international number and the application stop working after 10mins of talking and it later said you have run out of minutes. However, the apps was still showing that I have 42mins left and I left the dialled number to ring due to this, unknowingly to me the calls went to my phone network and I have been charged with ridiculous amount of money that went into my phone bill.

                I am a customer since 2014 and have had no issues until November 2018. Call quality is always good, rates are cheap for the countries I use.<br><br>The bad rating is for erroneous credit balances, awful customer support and, I suspect, an IT system that fails at basic accounting.<br><br>Issues with the credit balance:<br>- November 2018: payment not reflected<br>- March 2019: credit balance dropped to zero for no reason<br>- Now (November 2019): credit balance dropped to zero for no reason<br><br>Support:<br>In March, initially I got an automated email, then I was told that my credit had expired, and finally Rebtel admitted that they had ""experienced some temporary technical issues with our system, and indeed you have credits that were purchased"".<br>Now: created a ticket, will see ...<br><br>IT System:<br>Beside my suspicions, I have proof: I downloaded my Account Activity, and after every call or payment  since one year, the balance shows 0 (zero).<br><br>UPDATE 1<br>I see that there is already a reply here from Rebtel. Unfortunately, this *proves* my point about their customer support: <br><br>I created a ticket *before* posting this review on Trustpilot. No reaction yet to my ticket ...<br><br>UPDATE 2<br>After posting my first update, criticizing that Rebtel was very quick to answer here, but *not* responding to my support ticket, Rebtel modified their answer, citing a high volume of tickets.<br><br>It took them only 27 minutes. So, I have had 2 replies on Trustpilot, but none from customer support. <br>Clearly, Rebtel is more concerned trying to give a good impression on Trustpilot, where they are constantly monitoring, instead of actually *working* on tickets.

                I dont know where to start for this company. Their rates are sky high for some of the destinations compare to other providers. The call quality is next to zero and then when you need help that needs urgent attention, you got a team that is sitting behind a screen who will reply to your querry whenever they are bothered. They dont have a call centre you can call, they have a chat system on their system and when click on that its also an enquiry form that again goes to their team who will only reply if they are bothered. <br><br>The only thing they are best at is sending you constant texts and emails to rate their app and there you have it; A very honest review.

                It is my first time returning to Rebtel after many years. It has not been working for the whole day. It started with a bad experience of letting me validate my phone number only after some 20 attempts. It was weird as there are surely better-automated ways of validating a phone number these days. The app complained of poor network, which is actually not the case as I was connected via WiFi in central Europe. After that, no call has been going thru.

                Update: After a while it worked. A bit confusing as, in my case, the call needed to be done through a local number. Nice that company representatives answer here. <br>-----------<br>After having registered and put in my credit card details, I got the access details. So far so good. The only problem is... I am not able to call at all! The app seems to try to call a number, but it goes back after a second to a normal call choice from my mobile. <br>Very disappointing.

I just lost ¬£7 and have nothing to show for it.Saw a monthly subscription for worldwide calling at ¬£5 and thought to try it just to find out it doesnt include Cameroon,Complete Scammers!!! misrepresenting themselves.Tried to log in to cancel subscription and was unable to,and there is no uk number you can use to get through to them.STAY AWAY FROM REBTEL THESE ARE SCAMMERS!!!

Rebtel solved those issues! It's easy to access on web or app options, offers various payment options, the voice quality is great, provides constant reminders on my usage, and I can make my calls whether my contact has internet access or not. Need I say more? Try Rebtel and thank me later :)

                I have been using rebtel for a while. Initially the connection was good and the service was worth the money. But for couple of days now I had bad experiences.  Today is the worst. I keep adding money( 10dollars) to my account but the call does not even last 10min then it stated no credit left. When I add 10dollars it stated the call will last 34min. I real dont know what to think. I am thinking there must be other good services out there...very disappointed. I end up ending the call early as it keeps disconnecting me from my call.

                I was using rebetel for two weeks, and i found i was being charged by my mobile career. They charge me while using the rebtel app from my mobile, i was charged ¬£146 for using talk time minutes as well as mobile data.I am waiting to get it solved, if not i will consult a lawyer to sue this fraudulent company. Please do never use Rebtel, its a fraud company.<br><br>As of now, it has been 5 weeks, nothing has been done or resolved from Rebtel. All they are asking whether I made national or international calls.The best solution is to avoid Rebtel and be aware of using them in future.So basically they are asking me to pay the billed amount apart from paying their bills.I wonder how can such companies exist?

                Hi, before was so good Rebtel. But receiver dont hear to me when I bought this time. I called so many time. Every time i did not speak properly. I can hear but they cannot hear. every time you cut off money. Totally i wasted this money. Most of time i called , but showing calling to Bangladesh. But not. Fake ringing. Stop your business If cant give service. Don‚Äôt play with customer.

                I only used Rebtel to add funds to my family phones in Cuba through different promotions Rebtel has for Cubacel (Cuba provider). However, in February 2019, I made a transaction, Rebtel didn't process it for whatever reason (I just got an automatic response saying they couldn't process it at that moment), I waited, tried again, and it was processed fine. When I checked my bank statement, I found they charged me twice, so I called the bank and cancelled one of the transactions and forgot about it. <br>Later in June, I tried to use my Rebtel account to send funds to Cuba again, and my account was ""restricted"". I contacted Rebtel and the response I received was that they restricted my account because of my claim for the duplicated transaction and basically the only way for them to restore my account was if I told my bank I was wrong with the claim in first place. We went back and forth a couple of emails and they insisted with the pretension that I had to cancel my claim with the bank (by the way, we are talking about $20 here).<br>Of course, I am not going to do it because it wasn't my fault that their software didn't process it in first place, but did process the transaction after.<br>In my opinion, that is not the best way to handle a situation like this with a long term client. <br>As a result, I am using a different provider now.

                I was double charged by Rebtel on the same day and i disputed the charge with my bank directly as there is no direct line to call your customer service. Now Rebtel has blocked my account despite having the first payment made for an entire month, and customer care finally replies saying i need to show proof from my bank that i will remove the dispute and i should have contacted customer service. How are we supposed to trust a customer service where we are the mercy of someone replying to emails rather than getting immediate resolution, and i am sure most people miss double charges of small amounts like $10 unless they check card statements very closely . Very poor experience, and a lot of times the call drops too.

                Rebtel is messing around a lot, unfortunately because I cannot see my issues resolved as no-one is answering my emails and there is no number to call, I'm forced to come here again to another review and I will do it until my issues are solved.<br>I'm using rebtel for years using the same 020 rebtel numbers however since 12th June 2019 my calls to the same numbers are being overcharged, instead of 5p per minute it's around 30p per minute which is a lot. Because of that I spent in 2 calls what I usually spend in a month.<br>I just want to have all the money charged incorrectly returned and see this issue fixed. <br>Rebtel is trying to put the fault in my Internet provider but no chance as my bills from them are correct. <br>This is very annoying, I'm a person that like to be fair to everyone but rebtel is not being fair and is showing a very bad customer service. <br>I hope this gets resolved soon otherwise I will have to proceed to a formal complaint. <br>Thanks <br>Margarida

I am not sure why this happened. I emailed them and they said they have referred it to the correct department. However, nothing have been heard. They have stopped responding to my emails with no updates at all. My advice is avoid them if you can. They are a SCAM.

                Short version:<br>1. Rebtel can randomly lock up your account blaming VPN, which I believe is untrue as I have been using VPN every day for the past 1.5 years simultaneously with Rebtel. <br>2. When you get locked up, wave good bye to the money you spent on your subscription and do not expect any refunds. <br>3. Instead of a refund, expect they will just auto-renew your subscription and charge you for a new month because you won't be able to access your account to cancel the subscription. <br>4. Once you contact their customer services, be ready for an example of utterly miserable, inefficient customer services definitely not focussed on resolving issues or providing at least tolerable level of customer care. Expect poor response times beyond industry standards, customer services chronologically responding old emails without reviewing your latest emails. <br>5. Expect chaos and lack of compliance with legislation such as GDPR. Expect to be contacted via email addresses not linked to the email you used to register on Rebtel - potentially putting your account and data at risk<br><br>Detailed version:<br>I have used Rebtel for years and have dealt with their customer services on a number of occasions. Overall, it has always been slow and dreadful process to resolve any issue. I used to love Rebtel because it was the only company that actually really worked in terms of quality of calls and all that at reasonable prices. I have never really cared about Rebtel's technical issues (and I have experienced quite a few over the time) but rather the miserable, unprofessional, slow and unhelpful service they provided whenever I needed a help with any issue. Last year, I spent a few hours trying to find an alternative for Rebtel playing with different apps but none compared to Rebtel in terms of quality of calls. I carried on. Having been using VPN on a daily basis for a year and half, all of a sudden they blocked my account and started to request unreasonable amount and detail of information - when answered they would come up with a new set of ridiculous questions. I have done a few security verifications say with financial services companies and none was as bad as the one of Rebtel. Rebtel's security verification process is chaotic, non-systemic, random, unreasonable. I accidentally used my other email account for one of the emails I sent to them and I was politely informed they cannot reply emails that are coming from email addresses not linked to the email I used for my account registration, yet they would later contact me using that email account - chaotic and GDPR non-compliant. During the time I couldn't access my account I couldn't use my subscription minutes - yet they would reject my refund request. As I couldn't access my account to cancel the subscription instead of actually refunding me, they would charge me for another 30 days worth of their fantastic services. I requested my account to be closed and data wiped yet they would ignore my email and just reply some email I sent earlier completely disregarding what I requested. Rebtel's response time is way beyond industry standards, and their approach to dealing with queries chronologically is unprofessional and inefficient. Rebtel either clearly never heard about companies measuring response times and rate of customers whose query is resolved in one email or are really bad at managing these metrics. Rebtel will make you want to forget about the brand and business you once loved.<br><br>I have raised an official complaint with Rebtel and I am ready to protect my rights through escalation of my case to the authorities in charge of GDPR enforcement and fair trading such as Ombudsmans should Rebtel continue to further ignore my complaint or should they fail to resolve it. i will edit my Trustpilot with further details.<br><br>Edit #1: I had requested a refund and an account closure, but I received a response from Rebtel and world credits, which is basically the opposite of what I want - to get my money back and have my account closed.

                I made a money transfer through Rebtel in 2 weeks ago, till today, the money has not been delivered to the receiver account. What furious me most is that I was sending the money as a matter of emergency, and I was disappointed. I communicated to their technical crew, they said it might be invalid account number, which is not true, because I‚Äôve been using the same account number for long with other money transfer company. Now, they said they would refund the money and that was 3 days ago, till now, still waiting to get my refund. I will not allow anyone to do this anymore let alone myself. This is a big mistake

                I was always a happy customer with Rebtel, however, if you have a question about something the support writes ridiculous responses. I assume that messages are not read or maybe there is a lack of language knowledge. Recently, I figured out by myself that Austria was eliminated from the subscription. My question was simple ""What has happened with my subscription?"" and I received a lousy response. I was told that I did not make a payment that was not true. My subscription is automatically deducted from my credit card. In fact, Rebtel has eliminated Austria, Portugal, etc. from the subscription WITHOUT any notification that this will happen. This is very disappointing and I expect from an apparently professional provider a way much better support. Just copy and pasting any responding that does not make sense upset customers. More, customers will look for other companies. Makes sense?

                I was using REBTEL for a quite 3 weeks it was working perfect. No issues ... But suddenly from today when i call the number +1 800.361.6106. I get an error message stating ''app cannot connect. Please check the number and try again.<br>I was able to connect to the same above number  till yesterday and not sure what happened from today. I am not able to call customer care since no contact number . So raised a complaint no response yet to rectify it..<br>No proper responsibility from their support team to retain the customers.

                Rebtel is a cheap way to call Kenya from Germany. Even though it is sometimes tricky to know if the phone subscriber is reachable or not from the dial tone. On overall though, so far I find Rebtel cheap and clear in connectivity. Their customer support is open to criticism and will promptly respond to dissatisfaction.

                Good quality and price, for that alone this product is worth using. It would be nice if the app didn't provide a dialer but used the native dialer in the relevant OS. It would also be nice to offer a pinless dialing number so you could configure pauses with native dialer. The interfaces in both web/mobile are easy to navigate, however, the app does not provide the ability to configure local numbers. Finally, the iOS experience can be confusing as some apps have a cost and the main one does not. Room to improve but overall a good offering.

                The app was good but the pricing is not at all.  I live in Canada and i paid $5 but when i looked into my account i noticed you guys have taken $11 from my credit card for less than 50 Minutes.  Meanwhile, $10 dollar for other international calling would have given me 98 Minutes or more.  You need to review the pricing and also show Canadian Dollars to those of us that live in Canada so we know the actual amount we are paying for.

                Rebtel has fairly good prices to call to foreign countries BUT they have very often nice offers that are ONLY for new customers. I would like to ask Rebtel: how about rewarding faithful customers with a good offer or a discount from time to time??? I think it is very ugly to discriminate your faithful customers!

                When you have a complaint, there is no number for customers to call. I know that this is deliberate and until you have a problem and yearning to speak with a customer service agent, you wouldn't know how frustrating this could be. Also they don't reply emails about complaints. Its all about taking the money and giving crappy service back. I commented on their Facebook account when I couldn't get their attention and they blocked me. Wish I could rate zero star!!!

                This app is great. It seems that their rates vary quite a lot depending on where you need to call, but I pay $2 for unlimited calling to Canada, which is really quite amazing. The call quality is not amazing, and it seems like it‚Äôs even worse over speakerphone for some reason, but it‚Äôs still decent. There are a couple of minor bugs in the app, and call quality could be improved, but for the price, it‚Äôs great.

                I am finding it very expensive to use. They  say free Rebtel calls to the US. It is not free. I have my better half in South Africa. He downloaded the app thinking that we can talk rebtel to rebtel for free,  and his phone worked for about two calls and it quit working. It's not really free to call the US or unlimited to the US. I am trying now to connect and pay for his unlimited $10 a month plan from here to see if he is able to use that plan so we can communicate. But as I am registering his number, of course a pin is send to his number overseas and I can't finish the registration. <br>When I call to south Africa from the US I pay $25 and it only lasts two or three phone calls. In one week I can spend over $200. Customer service is none existent. No phone calls. So if you have an issue that needs immediate attention you are on your own.  They provide a fax number not a phone number to call have issues resolved.

                Easy to set up the app, and easy to use. I like the monthly pre-authorised payment. I like that the last calls I made are on the screen, especially as I call only a very few numbers. I wanted an app to call landlines primarily, and the sound both ways is very good. That said, I'm very happy to have the ability to call mobile phones without taking a separate contract (of course this will only work when the recipient's phone is actually charged and working! Brothers.....! Another time lol). I like your logo. I like that you are European rather than US-based. You don't clog my email or text messaging with pointless stuff. Nice clean design. I can take you with me and use you anywhere in Canada. My 91 year-old aunt in UK can talk for an hour or more (I think it was nearer 3 hours first time - hope that is considered reasonable use...) and I don't have to worry about the cost. What's not to like about you? Happy Canadian Thanksgiving!

Way better quality on the quality and connectivity than Cuballama and better prices than Neura Telecommunications. Although REBTEL has good promotions their prices have to go down more so, they can beat their competition(As far as Cuba concerns).<br>One aspect they need to improve is their customer service. It is basically nonexistence. Regardless of the time difference with the rest of the world REBTEL in Sweden and/or Luxembourg has to find the way to offer a real customer service, where customers can talk to you. Emails do not work, and if they do REBTEL do not answer your concern.

                I personally have found Rebtel service very useful as it helps me connect to my family back home and cheaper, however, my poor rating is due to the fact that I subscribed my account for one month as usual and I am not able to use the subscription, each time I dial any number, it says my subscription has expired while my subscription is seating there and wasting, it took ages to reach the support team who were useless at the end, they never solved my problem and I am so frustrated. I actually work hard for my money not to watch people take it away from me without a reason. How can I pay for a service and I am not allowed to use it? In advance here is my request number 1584788.

                I was travelling for a month in the Phillippines and subscribed for a new Rebtel plan while i was there as I had a new SIM. When i returned to my home country and used my old sim the app prompted me to confirmation process with old SIM and to only last for two days. I got a prompt that my subscription was over and to reactivate. When I reactivated the app had picked up my Philippines number instead of the home country number. <br>There is a bug in the app. The cache memory stores the old number for a period of time and deactivates the subscriptions. This happened with me and only to find that I was charged for a monthly subscription for two days, When reported the support team wouldnt consider at all and wouldnt accept it was their app issue. No one would purchase a monthly subscription for two days and when requested for a refund they wouldnt respond for a week and then come back and say the risk is all customers after installing the app. No ownership from Rebtel and wouldnt take any steps to look into the issue. <br><br>I am going to put it in all the forums and hope Rebtel would take some ownership and fix this issue.<br><br>Ticket number.. 1574571‚Äç and the guys supported was Ryan

                Reliable; good quality. Sometimes it happens that the other side cannot hear the caller, but this might not be Rebtel's fault. One thing that I do not like, is that you see the Rebtel local number on the screen, when you call someone. I would prefer to see the called number and the picture of the called person, and not some unknown local number.

                For me this is very easy to use when traveling or keeping in touch with my friends in foreign countries. Rebtel  is especially helpful in foreign travel situations where I might need to call beforehand to hotels or friends while arranging plans who might not be connected already with apps like WhatsApp that requires both users to participate. Rebtel  helps me contact people regardless and at very practical rates. Equally convenient is that I can cancel subscriptions when I don't need them and that is a major selling point for me. It is true that the calls are only as secure as the connection the app uses (and I have had a dropped call or two) but nothing to actually keep me from holding a needed conversation with someone. This was perfect for me, an occasional traveler who didn't want to opt in to exorbitant international cellphone plans when I may only need to connect with one or two countries at a time.

Three times I needed to recharge my mobile with data only because Rebtel doesn't work without the Internet, even if my mobile is connected to a wifi connexion. <br><br>The other thing that I didn't like was that the add said the price will be only 11 dollars but since the beginning, the payment was 15 dollars.

When someone disconnects the call, it gets automatically redialed.<br>2. When for some reason, like receiver's mobile is switched off or out of network, you cannot hear the default company responses but hear the normal dial tone.<br>3.

                Honestly I don‚Äôt even know what to say anymore about this crap application. I really regret switching from Libon to this !!!! I only use it to call to Angola and only 1/10 call goes through. I have problems every single time and have to try 8-9 times before succeeding. This is really frustrating !!! Here are the problems that I have every single time :<br><br>- the phone of the person I call sometimes doesn‚Äôt even ring <br><br>- several (a LOT) times, the counter starts but I‚Äôm still hearing the bell...and i lose minutes with that !!!!!!<br><br>- have to try at least 10 times before getting someone on the line !!!<br><br>- several times the line drops after 1-2 minutes and all I hear is the same conversation from 1-2 minutes earlier repeating again and again !!! Are you guys recording us ?!! And the worst thing is that the minutes keep on going off....!!!!<br><br>It‚Äôs been a while that I wanted to delete this application and get back to Libon or Skype, even though they are more expensive but at least o don‚Äôt lose time and money and it works perfectly.<br><br>This time I‚Äôm done with this BULLSH*T app. You guys are really about to lose a very good customer!!!<br><br>Bye bye

4 stars: Great,"<p class=""review-content__text"">
                Rebtel is a relatively good service, with some problems.  Customer service is generally good, but not always consistent.  Sometimes it can be very frustrating, but I think people who actually pay for their call (like me) would care more versus someone who use the free calling feature.  <br>     Calls do have connection problems from time to time, which can be a problem if you are calling about something important. <br>     The monthly subscription plan for calling to specific country can be frustrating because the minutes do not rollover and the renewal is every 30 days (meaning you have to keep track of 30 days, there is no set day for renewal). This means the plan will not renew on the 13th of every month, but varies based on thirty days from your initial subscription - so next month could be on the 11th instead of the 13th and you will lose all minutes you did not use.<br>     Customer service is usually good about reimbursement for dropped calls and other connection problems, but they have this ridiculous policy of only reimbursing for calls under a minute or some brief time like that.  If you have connection problems in the middle of a longer call, you are going to have a tough time getting then to address the problem. This is a big problem when I call to Asia, the first few minutes could be good, but sound quality may start deteriorating thirty minutes in or the call could suddenly end.

                12p a minute to South Africa is good value. The quality of the line is very good, which hasn't always been the case when I've used other providers. I've given it four stars rather than five just because it does lack a bit of flexibility in that you have to sign up to phone a particular number in advance, rather than being able to call different people as the need arises.

                In the past I would have given 5 stars, for being an amazing help in my ability to communicate with foreign cell numbers. But my last few calls have come down to high cost anyway, which was surprising.  Maybe they have changed something in their fine print that I can't find.

                I can make unlimited calls using my landline to a landline in Spain.  It sounds as clear as when I paid much more per month for Xfinity's International calling plan.<br>I had trouble understanding how to get started and how the entire thing worked, but once I did (and that took me a looong time emailing and chatting with a rep) it worked well for me.  It saves me at least $30 per month.

                I have been having great problem making international calls. After dialing, I keep connected to an operator in France who tells me the number I am trying to reach does not exist. So now, for a month or so, I have stopped calling international.

                I recently purchase rebtel services to call India, on 5/12-28, it billed $10 every week they have some option to auto deduct money from your card once balance is less than $1 so it billed 4 times in a month before I noticed my credit card transaction, don‚Äôt rely on this services and never save your credit card on their site, and customer services will never understand customer issue, biggest irony is this company is it provides calling services to world but they don‚Äôt have customer service number where you can connect! Their customer service is so rude you cannot believe don‚Äôt buy this product and be very careful about transaction.

                I am making international call from Spain to Bangladesh. I bought a monthly package. But while calling with Phone Lines, rebtel is using my mobile network and thereby my phone balance has been used for international calls, as well as my purchased minutes in rebtel also has been used. I don't understand this! When my phone has no balance, rebtel don't allow me to call with Phone Lines option.<br><br>Is that a problem or cheating?

                Been using Rebtel for months only to realise that my mobile network has been charging me for all international calls I made via Rebtel. Rebtel has also been charging me for my international calls so I am being charged twice. Paying full direct costs for all international calls and also being charged by Rebtel. This has cost me several hundreds of ¬£¬£¬£S over the past few months. How is it possible that Rebtel has been charging me for international calls through its UK access no and also my phone provider is charging me for the same calls at full international mobile phone rates??? Beware of Rebtel as you may end up paying twice for calls incurring additional costs without realising - check your phone bills!! And unfortunately its not possible to contact anyone at Rebtel by phone to even make a complaint.

                I made my first Rebtel call last nite. It took me an hour to figure out how to do this, including putting ""credit card"" info in so that I would have ""money in the account, then how you actually dial the number, recognizing a code that comes up and then finally figuring it out. The connection to the Philippines was good, there was a two second delay between us, but we learned to work with that , and I think as I use the service more, it will be much easier to use. When you are of the ""ancient"" variety, it's probably more challenging than for a young person !

                I am sharing my honest experience with Rebtel here as I am extremely shocked at how the company had an app malfunction, wherein I was charged for international calls by my provider. over $100 dollars in fees and Rebtel is just finding excuses trying to brainwash me into thinking I did something wrong. <br>Facts:<br>1 - Was traveling, had unlimited Roaming Data <br>2 - Turned on Wifi and 3G/4G option, as recommended with unlimited data<br>3 - Was charged by my operator for using phone lines (was never on)<br><br>So please be aware, the app didnt work properly and instead of using my roaming data, Rebtel connected me via phone lines (this option was disabled) <br><br>Best thing now, Rebtel refuses to stand up for the app glitch and trying to twist a million things on me, so ist my fault!<br>Who wouldnt feel cheated ? Oh and trust me when you contact their customer support, you dint feel taken seriously. Just excuses, twisted explanations and no action ! <br><br>REBTEL willing to stand up for your mistake now?

Once escalated with Rebtel they looked into the issue and they instantly resolved the same and even compensated for the losses of mine.. that was really a great gesture from their side and hence I can recommend Rebtel as a very customer focused product.

                All contact to rebel is confined to their website or email. I was able to find a telephone number, but that was limited to staff, who were unable to help me. Eventually, by following the protocol I was able to obtain a resolution to my problem. <br>The Rebtel site is geared to a younger crowd and not well understood by older people, who are not in tune with either the language or the nuances of smartphones.

                The service is economical and reliable.  There are two problems using this app with android.  When I have the settings set to route international calls through Rebtel,  I dial the international number through the native dialer and  about 5% or 10% of the time the app fails to activate and the call goes through my usual phone provider, resulting in HORRIFIC  charges.  I realize my mobile providers charges are not Rebtela fault, but the failure of the call to route through Rebtel Is their fault.  The app needed to work reliably and predictably.  The other problem is that sometimes the app picks up the international call (which is good) but their system fails to recognize my number (the caller id might not be giving Rebtel the right number to associate the account to). Rebtel needs to figure out how to associate they phone with the account when caller Id on the phone fails.  Other than those two failures I can't fault the service

                After having used myself the app, I gladly recomended it to a friend in order to save money on her phone calls to Romania. Made sure the app was installed properly and tested; it worked really well while the handset was connected to wi-fi and no network charges have applied, but as soon as she used the Rebtel app, while on the go, with no internet connection, Lycamobile network charged her phone calls at standard rates, eventhough she‚Äôs made them through the app! therefore out of ¬£10 balance, she was left with 10p after speaking on the phone for less than 1 hour. <br>I find this experience extremely upsetting and I hold Rebtel responsible for what happened! My friend should have her ¬£10 back in a form of compensation! <br>If this complaint isn‚Äôt sorted properly I will stop my subscription with Rebtel and I will advise all my acquaintances to stay away from it!

                Their timer runs faster like a rigged taxi meter once the call starts.<br>The Rebtel app timer would show 60 seconds elapsed since the call began whereas in reality only 50-55 would have passed. I confirmed this today with an experiment. Its a simple experiment anyone could try at home. All you need is two smart phones. Make a call using Rebtel app, once the called party responds, its timer begins to roll. Exactly at that instant start a timer on the other smartphone. At the end of the call, rebtel app would have clocked considerably more seconds than the timer on the other phone. Don't believe me? Repeat the experiment from your end and come back and tell me.<br>Einstein forgot to include Rebtel's time rigging in his theory of relativity and now there is no Hawking either who could add this blunder in his diss for Albert!

                WHO are you?! Your company requested $25(USD) from my bank account, yet I've never applied for your services! Help me make the connection IF there is one, please? If none, let's get the imposters! <br>   I made my first long-distance call of a decade to Africa recently on my home phone, serviced by my cable company. They claim no affiliation. I also recently sent money overseas via the ""WAVE"" app. Any relation to them? <br>   The Rebtel (communications) company that wants my money is, supposedly, out of Luxembourg - whereas you are Sweden-based. Perhaps that may be helpful. And have you had other such complaints about ""clone"" (bogus!) companies and billings? I'd love to sort this out! Thanks for any help.

                On 12th February 2018 I made a Rebtel call to a UK TOLL FREE (0800) number, lasting 45 minutes.  The charge amounted to $ 22.05, making this call almost $0.50/minute!  If I had made a call to an ordinary landline in the UK I would have been charged $ 0.01 MAXIMUM.<br><br>I was therefore charged 50 TIMES a normal call charge!!!<br><br>When I made an online complaint directly with Rebtel NOTHING happened.  In a subsequent Online Chat with them I was asked for a SUPPORT TICKET #, which was NOT SENT TO ME!<br><br>Eventually, I was refunded $ 10, which is far short of what I expected (i.e. 100% refund).  A TOLL FREE number costs Rebtel NOTHING, and yet they are happy to charge 50 TIMES a normal call charge for this.<br><br>A further online complaint to them did not generate a SUPPORT TICKET # either, and I have still not received a refund, as requested.<br><br>I am so unhappy with Rebtel that I will most likely move to another provider when my credit is depleted.

                Rebtel is worth every dollar. The call quality is mostly great. The reason for 4 star is because of the reason the call goes blank briefly at times (not often). Other than that I am happy to be a Rebtel customer .

                Start charging you before the call is connected.  You pay them to tell you that your welcome minutes are finished which we never ask for anyway.  A minute is not a  because when their automated system starts talking that's when they start billing you,  they should start billing when the call is connected.  Please check your screen you will see what I am taking about. Whether it's connected or not you lose a minute,  you try again another minute is gone.

                I recently had a bad experience with Rebtel. I was charged $7.90 for allegedly ordering 50 minutes to United Arab Emirates. I did not make that purchase. Moreover, I have never had reason to call that country or buy minutes for UAE. Therefore, I called my bank to dispute the transaction. When I complained to Rebtel, they ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù my account and demanded that I cancel the dispute and accept the (unauthorized) charge. Really? The bottom line is I will no longer use their services. There are so many free alternatives: WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook Messenger, Googlechat and so on and so forth. I‚Äôm hoping they give me a refund for any unused minutes. Unfortunately, I cannot check to see if I have unused minutes because they have blocked my account. What a way to approach customer service!! Just shut the customer up?! Ridiculous. First I got a message from Rebtel agreeing to the refund of $7.90. Then I got the following message (which is an exact copy of theirs): <br><br>‚ÄúYour account was locked due to a payment dispute. The payment you made with your Visa ending on - - - - on 2018-01-26 20:37:37 is currently under dispute, which means that you or the cardholder reported the payment as unauthorized.<br><br>A common cause for reversed payments is insufficient funds or payment fraud so the locking of the account is measured we take to protect the owner of the Used credit card.<br><br>To unlock your Rebtel account, we kindly suggest you cancel these disputes and please also provide us with a written confirmation of your bank of the canceled disputes and saying that you recognize that payment and accept the charge.‚Äù<br><br>UPDATE: Below is Rebtel‚Äôs response to my request for reimbursement for unused minutes. I wrote it after their comment below. I still have not received the reimbursement and I cannot access Rebtel to figure out what that amount is!  Just lovely! <br><br>‚ÄúThanks for getting in touch! We are still in the timeframe, please allow 3-5 business days to reflect the amount in your account that we have refunded. Have a great day!<br><br>Best Regards,<br>Ryan<br>Customer Team‚Äù

                I originally subscribed for a free trail for unlimited calls to India. I paid a few months after the trail and cancelled the 'Auto renew' using the app. I got a confirmation on the App screen that it was cancelled. However I got charged after a month. I emailed customer services they said that I did not cancel and confirmed that it will be cancelled from the date of the email. Two months later I noticed my back account, I have still been charged for the service they have not given me. Cowboys!

                Quick connection with my family in Cuba, clear (no static or delays), connected on the first try, more affordable than my telephone carrier. I like the idea of calls being dropped after 15 minutes because all important conversation can be said in that time. You must prepay for the calls and I buy 15 minutes at a time.  They have an international deal that's great (unlimited calls), but Cuba is not included.

The rates are very reasonable, and I now have the numbers for each friend saved in my contacts list on my cell phone, and I just press the name and it dials them up. No need to dial an international access code or anything. It is as easy as dialing my next door neighbor. <br>My mom used the service whereby for only $2.00/month, she can make unlimited calls to my sister who lives in Mexico. <br>The $2.00 is just auto deducted from her credit card each month.

                I used a Rebtel number in Dec, and reached to total strangers. I tried 3 times and got the same results, was charged for these malfunctioned phone calls.

Rebtel began charging the current/active card in March, when I made the switch. However, my $24 credit was refunded to my already cancelled credit card, which I had no access to it. <br><br>I went back &amp; force with numerous Rebtel reps, they all repeated the same thing ‚Äì too bad, we can‚Äôt help you, you got to work with your ‚Äúbank,‚Äù as shown below:  <br><br>‚ÄúHi Aki,<br><br>We love to assist your concerned but it's already beyond our control the best thing you can do is to contact your bank to resolve this matter. <br><br>Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.<br>Best Regards,<br>Customer Team‚Äù<br><br>If you are canceling a Rebtel account, make sure use up all credit ‚Äì because, if you have multiple credit cards loaded in your account, you have no guarantee they will refund your credit to your most current card. Nobody at Rebtel bothers to check which card is the most recently used ‚Äì if your refund was sent to your closed/cancelled credit card, all you will get is, ‚ÄúToo bad!

                In the years we have used Rebtel, I have to say that we have not been disappointed one time with the service.  We use Rebtel for all International and some Domestic calls.<br>The ""Local Number"" capability is brilliant.  Our International contacts have all been set up with local numbers.<br>While we do use cell phones on rare occasions, we prefer the land-line, so we have no experience with Rebtel on cell phones.  Our review, therefore, is based on land-line experience.

                It is very disappointing service. I have used rebtel for years and now they decided to restrict my number. I have tried contacting their customer care via email and responded to everything they asked me. They unlocked and locked it back within a day. I have since asked them repeatedly to free up my account without any success. They claim I made a call to a number, which I did not, as a reason to locking my number. Super SHADY! <br>The main point is, their customer care is not good at all, if you had any issue, there is no way to get it resolved easily. It's taking them weeks to resolve my problem, which means I have to find other means of calling long distance! very Disappointing!!<br><br>Update: as of today January 11/2018 I have not heard from the Rebtel customer service representatives. I have repeatedly asked them to see what is going on. It seems like they just don't care??!!

                My family lives in Switzerland, calling them would cost me 1.32 CAD per minute with my home phone provider (we live off-grid and have VoIP via satellite internet). As local calls are free with our provider Rebtel is perfect for us. We pay 5 Dollars a month, can add unlimited Swiss phone numbers (landlines and cell phone numbers) and talk for free. On our end we dial always the same local number assigned to the Swiss number, so it can be saved on the phone. My family and friends still see our normal number displayed on their phone and call us on our normal number. Rebtel doesn't change anything on our end. <br>I installed the Rebtel app on my smartphone too and it works great as long as I am having cell service. VoIP with the cell didn't work well, but as I mentioned, our internet comes over a satellite.

                Not satisfied with Rebtel :( Service of rebtel is really worst. I didn't got a single call to solve my issue. I have send more than 8 mails. Rebtel customer support told me that they will give me 7 days trial. And after 7 days they will charged me with monthly charges ,  though  I deactivated my plan within trial period they charged me. This is really insane :( Not happy with the service :( The customer support people are not able to understand customers problem. I have asked yesterday to Samuel about my trial expiration and date and when will I get charged . I was told 11th of Dec is my last day and when I discontinued my service they charged me sending mail. <br>Its VERY MUCH DISGUISTING.....!!!<br>NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE...<br>:(<br>Even there is no phone or live chat support with this call service. If we send email to them they just send ticket number.... which is of no use. Will not at all recommend any of my friend for the same.<br>Many times calls don't connect and sometimes you call the number and rings and answer some other person answer the call. Getting cross connections many times... :(

                Quality of support was quite terrible, not only coming from her part, but in general- as this issue has been going on for overa month, and has reached over 6 emails to have it resolved. The overall outcome is satisfactory, but has taken up a lot of my time and patience to have it resolved, and I am not pleased about that. As you can see, the overall conversation took well over 40 minutes, and her conclusion of the initial problem or issue was. Or only inaccurate, but she kept on persisting that the issue of payment was not made in error (which isn‚Äôt the problem) but having the credit expire, and an apparent subscription which I have never signed up for, and my account clearly indicated that ‚ÄúI Have No Active Subscriptions‚Äù. Needless to say, I will not be continuing my service with your company due to the neglect (Iver 6 emails sent without a single response) that has taken place over a month of reaching out, in addition to the quality of everything I had received, the unprofessionalism, in addition to having the issue (which is minor) not resolved in an efficient manner, nor time efficient.

                It seemed like a great service reading the website. I need to call abroad a lot as part of my profession so it seemed perfect, until I actually used it. I was promised 325 minutes calls to the UK for 8 euro (2.5 cent per minute), while some calls worked out at 2.5c per minute, other calls to the UK were costing about 60 cent per minute. So that meant that my 325 minutes were really about 20-30 minutes. And to add, I've been trying to call and email Rebtel about this issue for the last 3 days and haven't got one answer. Extremely frustrating because it's disrupted calls with clients. Maybe someone can finally respond on this website.

                I enrolled today to RebTel to call my relatives abroad.  I signed up, enrolled and paid 1GBP for their introductory campaign of 1GBP for 30 minutes.  I dialled the phone number abroad. The number on screen changed from my desired dialled number to 0333-241-4416.  The line kept on ringing and ringing.  I dialled and dialled and on the the third time (the number re-appeared on screen 0333-241-4416, it seemed it connected since a voice came off the phone. As I listened into it, I cannot recognize it. It sounds like a native english speaker.  It's a old man's voice talking about the spirit of his dead mother.

                Rebtel, I USED to love your service. But day by day your quality is getting worse. And I'm not talking about call quality. <br>I used to be able to call from both my registered numbers, and we are two people in the household who regularly call India, Australia, UK, and Sweden. Now only one phone can use Rebtel at a time and you have withdrawn the ability to use both devices simultaneously. Moreover every time I try calling a new number in India it keeps telling me that I have exceeded the number of phones I can call from my Rebtel account. I've used other services before, and this is simply not the most customer-friendly policy you have. I do not use it for commercial purposes, but I do have a lot of relatives and friends I like to keep in touch with. Please be more honest with your customers and improve your service otherwise I am taking my business elsewhere.

                Hi to all reading my review,<br><br>I didn't want to come here to give negative review about Rebtel though I did come to this site before becoming a customer of Rebtel and read one of the reviews where company representative replied saying only those customers come here who have complaints and not the ones who have positive experience with us to give positive feedback. I was absolutely wrong to trust that statement.<br><br>My phone is not working since 24-Oct-17. I have written to them like every second day but of no use. No replies. No follow up and unfortunately for Rebtel I had to come here to give my negative rating. <br><br>No one is bothered at all in this company to communicate with customer. After I reported the problem Rebtel wrote to me only once sending me questionnaire and I replied on all those questions and after that there was no reply at all even though I wrote to them when it would start working again? I think probably Rebtel could not solve it. Rebtel withdrew the money from my account and within couple of days all the local numbers stopped working. <br><br>I would request Rebtel please put the money back to my account and stop to cheat the people who trust you.<br><br>Thank you !<br><br>That's my ticket number - 1317999‚Äç , If you cant do anything please put the money back to my account.<br><br><br>What a shameful behaviour from you Rebtel and Tatiana. you asked me the ticket number and then again no communication at all. Phone still not working. Stop cheating your customers and put the money back to my account you thieves.<br><br>I would like to add in here that Rebtel put the money back to my account post my complaint on this forum although Rebtel didn't take any action on my repeated complaints about the service when I was writing to the customer service on their website. I thank you Rebtel and Tatiana for depositing the money back to my account.<br><br>Cheers !

                I've been using Rebtel for so many years. Initially, everything was great, quality was great. Then they started changing their policies, changed their plans and subscriptions, and increased the rates. It's been a few days now when I try to call home, the operator keeps saying we can't connect your call. I contacted customer service and they told me that the number is unreachable, don't call otherwise your account is going to be blocked. I tried a different app but I didn't experience such an issue. I emailed them a few times but never responded to my emails. This is absolutely unacceptable and poor customer service. I do not recommend Rebtel to anyone unless they change the experience to how it used to be 3 years ago.

                I have been used Rebtel over 4 years, recently the quality was so bad.  Many time, I start talking, then about 40 seconds, the conversation from the other side just keep repeat and repeat.  After I use another way to contact with them, I realize the call was hang off already.  However, in my side, the phone still keep repeating the conversation from the other side.  I am so disappointed about this quality and so frustrated.

Lately, their call quality degraded. <br>We cant even hear what person on other side is speaking. <br>They cant hear me also. <br><br>I tried contacting to customer care and they asked so many questions but no resolution. <br>its more than a month now I am facing this issue. planning to DISCONTINUE the service after the end of this month.

                I HAVE BEEN USING REBTEL SINCE LAST 4 MONTHS, THEY WERE GREAT, I HAD UNLIMITED SOUTH AFRICA PLAN, THEY WITHOUT ANY NOTIFICATION DISCONNECTED THE SUBSCRIPTION, AND WHEN CONTACTED THROUGH EMAIL, GAVE A UNREASONABLE REASON THAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN CARRIERS INCREASED THEIR RATES BY 12 TIMES, ITS UNBELIEVABLE AND I FIND IT A VERY LAME EXCUSE, WHERE OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE STILL THE SAME RATES, THE MISSION AND GOAL OF REBTEL WAS TO SAVE MONEY FOR THE USERS IN A MARKET THAT IS DOMINATED BY CALLING CARDS AND INTERNATIONAL CALL CENTERS, THEY ACTUALLY ARE COSTING MULTIPLE TIMES MORE THAN THAT, ANOTHER THING IS THAT EVEN WHEN THE UNLIMITED PLAN DISCONTINUED, THE FIXED MIN PLANS SEEMS TO HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES IN THE POSSIBLE WHOLE WORLD, I AM HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY REBTEL. I RECOMMENDED REBTEL TO SEVERAL PEOPLE, BUT THIS EXPERIENCE REBTEL DEFINITELY IS GONNA LOOSE A LOT OF MARKET COVERAGE, GOOD LUCK, IF REBTEL OPERATES IN THIS MANNER, GOD BLESS TO THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY.

                My mom uses Rebtel, pays monthly and loves it. Since I'm out of the country now, I wanted to use her account to make cheap calls to the U.S. It seems like you can't do this though, so I went to the site to make my account and chose the option to call the U.S. free. Now, AT&amp;T notified me my bill would be $537, and when I said i don't use my phone the calls they were seeing are through Rebtel so it means they're not doin their job. Luckily, it was rerated to $150, but I feel bad as my mom shouldn't have to pay that when the only calls I make are through the app, claiming my calls are free. I've even seen in my call history calls I never made to Maine, for example. What is that? I can't even find a customer service number. Would be better if my mom and I could share an account, or to have them pay this bill for bad service and see how to fix this so I can use them in the future again. A contact email would be great.

                I like your low costs. you can improve services by announcing the number of minutes left after one dials the international number. this would allow a person to hang up once he/she realizes that the cost is much higher than expected. for example, I called an 800 number in UK. Well you charge almost 60 cents per minute for such calls as opposed to about 1 cent otherwise. If I could have heard the number of minutes upon dialing, I would have hung up. my Ooma service charged me only 3 cents for the 800 call.

I called to check this up was told it was some sort of fraud then my rebtel account gets cut off. I contacted rebtel they said that I put a fraud action against them little did I know them charges were from rebtel!!!!!!! Now rebtel Wil not allow me to use their app or calling services!!!! Even though I called them to explain that I didn't know it was rebtel charges (still don't understand why they were charging me random fees but hey!)

                1. Sometimes the quality of the connection is very poor and the voice comes with a huge delay. <br>2. When you are about 1 minute away from the zero balance, the automatic voice announces about this long enough blocking completely the conversation, so you can not hear a person on the other end. Guys, I do know what I should do, just give me a signal that I'm almost out of money on the rebtel account. You will stop the connection as soon as I'm $0.01 anyway. Situations can be different, you never know, so why stealing those precious seconds of conversation? I do really hope you'll solve it the nearest time.

                Thanks to Trustpilot for provding a platform to exchange with and inform others.<br><br>For Rebtel:  I'm not even going to dignify your ignorant answer below with a reply, as it would be an insult to my intelligence. <br><br>For others:<br>Following up on my 1star (if I could I'd give no star) review, seeing that Rebtel Custome Service responds to 'public' reviews on sites like these, rather than through their customer support line.<br><br>First to my issue for contacting them (FAKE unlimited calling!!!). I can see why some people on Trustpilot think their customer service is a machine responding and not a real person. I clearly stated that my UNLIMITED CALLING plan says  'UNITED STATES UNLIMITED': call ANY NUMBER in  the United States AS MUCH AS YOU WANT, both landline and mobile' and even sent them a screen shot of that!!!! But they just send the same answer over and over again. <br><br>HEY REBTEL IF YOU DON'T KNOW ENGLISH DON'T USE IT!!! U N L I M I T E D MEANS NO that's - NO RESTRICTIONS -!!!!. If you're as sophisticated a service as you claim to be - newsflash - it's 2 0 1 7 find a way to weed out your commercial scammers with  2 0 1 7 technology. <br><br>Second: I've taken the time to read reviews - or rather mostly 1 star ratings - about Rebtel on this site. SAME COMPLAINTS OVER AND OVER GOING SEVERAL YEARS BACK!!!! A N D SAME INCOMPETENT ANSWERS OVER AND OVER!!!!They clearly have several disclosure issues but on their website they claim<br>'Legal information<br>Here at Rebtel we‚Äôre committed to managing our business in a transparent and ethical way. We promise to always be upfront with our customers about how our business works (and especially what it costs)'. <br><br>In 2013 Rebtel reported revenue of $95 million (source: Wikipedia), which can't be that hard to reach if you don't disclose to your customers...<br><br>I won't go into even more details - AS IT IS THEIR JOB NOT MINE to read customer reviews and MAKE CHANGES ACCORDINGLY. From the time I've spent reading complaints there are SEVERAL ISSUES (that KEEP COMING UP!!) THEY SHOULD ADDRESS, to retain customers and their satisfaction.<br><br>Rebtel should also keep in mind - that for every customer that takes the time and effort to file a complaint - there is a huge percentage out there that doesn't and just leaves and let's all their friends know HOW BAD REBTEL IS!! I very rarely write reviews and my last one here was approx. 2013 - and it was positve (and waaayyyy shorter).<br><br>To sum up Rebtel<br>1) They don't disclose properly on several issues<br>2) When contacted -if they answer- it is inadequate, bordering on stupid<br>3) They are more likely to respond if you give them a bad review on a 'public' site (although they quite often claim they can't find your info, tix#, etc.)<br>4) The issues are not likely to get resolved (see also  point 2 above)<br>5) Conclusion -&gt; why stay with Rebtel, when they don't provide what they say they do, don't seem to care about their customer's satisfaction and DON'T FIX THE PROBLEMS THEY CAUSE!!<br>6) It's 2017 there are plenty other providers out there.... <br>======================================================<br>My original review:<br>NO unlimited calling - as their deal said! BAD customer service!<br>I have the same problems as many other reviewers. I bought the unlimited calling to the USA which reads 'United States Unlimited, call any number in the United States as much as you want, both landline and mobile'.<br><br>However, yesterday I tried to make a call and got a message that I could only call 30 unique numbers during my billing period, and that unlimited was not for commercial calling!?<br><br>I emailed support and heard back- basically the same thing I got from the phone message when I tried to make the call the night before. I replied, that I am making private calls, but that I'm abroad right now and need to stay in touch w/ people for important things, including the hurricanes that are currently ravaging.<br><br>I also included a screen shot of my 'so called unlimited deal!'. Still haven't heard back!!<br><br>I appreciate that they want keep commercial callers out - but they have to come up w/ something much better than just cutting off customers unexpectedly.<br><br>I've started to look around for other services -even though I've been w/ Rebtel for many years. Txs to whoever suggested to try TELZ

I was just helping those who do not have a credit card. It will not happen in future. Hope you can unlock me. I am not writing this to unlock my account. Even if you do not unlock me I will not change my review again. But I would be grateful if you can unlock me this time.

                I subscribed to a monthly plan of 2‚Ç¨ for Austria however in July they raised the monthly fee to 7‚Ç¨. <br>I only accidentally found this out when opening the app and buying another bundle. <br>I was not informed about the price change: the app doesn't not notify about it and even the email which should notify this was not received.<br>Happily I got the money refunded ""because I didn't make a call in that month"".<br><br>Rebtel, generally you do a good job and I had for many years only very good experiences. <br>However changing subscription prices and only sending one E-Mail which like in my case may not even be received is unacceptable in my eyes. <br>I am sure many of your users will only after a couple months realize that they paid more than they expected.

If you dont want to unlock my rebtel account then give me a refund people!!!<br>This rebtel company is sooooo ridiculous when it comes to communication esp when problems occur!

                Rebtel used to be a well organized company in the past. Some of us find the company to be useful and beneficial before but unfortunately that is not the case recently. How could a 24th century company not have ANY means for the customers to reach out to them? There is no link for email or phone number contact  under the section ..HELP.... on their website. .. I am having issues adding a second number to my account and couldn't get any help from nobody. . The site kept saying 'we are calling. .press 1 to verify your number' but no call ever came through. The good thing is that they have a strong competitor in the US. I tried BOSS Revolution and it seems to work better or at least. ..you can get hold of someone when you need to... thanks.

                I started Rebtel with the ""try it free for 1 week"" with subscription for Indonesia unlimited - I've made a couple of calls to Indonesia and they were great. On the last day of that 1 week free trial, when I tried to make a call, I got the message saying,""Your account balance is too low..."" so without knowing the app very well I  accidentally put $10 on the world credit. I emailed the ""help"" at Rebtel and I got a reply which was basically saying that they can't refund my world credit and they are basically using whichever credit with the closest valid date (I honestly didn't really understand it, but I let it go). The next day when my 1 week free trial is up, I paid the $10 monthly subscription for Indonesia Unlimited (6/29/2017) and I can also see that my world credit balance has kept going down as I made calls to Indonesia (which I thought it was supposed to be covered by the monthly subscription). Today (7/7/17) with ACTIVE Indonesia unlimited account (renewed in 23 days) and $6.14 in my World Credits - I placed a call to Indonesia and guess what? I got this message again: ""Your account balance is too low..."" Uuumm...can anyone give me a reasonable explanation for this please?! I feel like canceling my account at this time but I would like my money back first. Thank you.<br><br>UPDATE:<br>I emailed Rebtel Support regarding this problem and I got their response within less than 24 hours. We were emailing back and forth regarding this issue. They asked me several questions and I answered them in details. On the same day (less than 24 hours), we figured out what's wrong: I had my iPhone set up with hidden caller ID that way Rebtel couldn't recognized my phone number (which is the account) when I was placing the calls. I did this setting a couple days ago when I was using my cellphone for work and I forgot to change back the setting.<br>Having said that, problem solved and I think Rebtel Customer Support team were VERY responsive and really on top of it to get to the bottom of the problem I was experiencing.<br>Not going to cancel my account. Thank you!

                Very poor service.<br>I purchased a subscription with Rebtel last month June for less than ¬£10. I followed the instructions that was given to me. I made two phone calls to Portugal and I was charged by 02 just over ¬£28 for two calls around 22 minutes. I am very glad that I didnt use it more that otherwise I would be charged a fortune. I sent a few e-mails to Rebtel but didnt get any answers. I am afraid I will be looking into it and make a complaint.<br>I am very unhappy with the service.

I cancelled the account thinking that the account would still be valid till July 25th because I have already paid 10$ for the following month. But when I hit cancel account everything associated with my account is gone and so is my 10$. I am trying to find a customer service number to no avail.

                Feel like being cheated<br><br>I started with Rebtel last month on a trial period and signed up for their $10/month for unlimited calls to India. Just now I tried calling a friend and there was an automated message that youve reached the max limit of unique numbers you could call. ARE YOU SERIOUS? I bought this thing so that I could make non commerical calls to family and friends back in India. Why would you restrict this to a few numbers. Whatever dumb person in your company has made this decision let them know that Indians have wider social group and we are a community oriented group. If you dont fix my account to take this restriction off NOW, I am straight away disconnecting mine and three other similar connections. This aint worth it.

                It all started great with an unlimited plan. But after a few weeks I can't make any new calls. A voice tells me that I may not use Rebtel for business calls and that I can call the numbers I called before, but not any new numbers. I don't know why they don't keep their promise of an umlimited plan, but this feels like I'm being scammed. Very unhappy about Rebtel.<br><br>UPDATE: I got a very fast and kind reply by Rebtel, but unfortunately I don't know how to reply to their answer. So I'll try this way: if there is indeed a limit to the number of phone numbers you can call in one month, Rebtel cannot call the plan ""unlimited"" anymore. Your customers should know about this limitation upfront and you need to tell them how many numbers they have used and how many they have left. Transparency, please!<br><br>I think I understand Rebtel's problem, but what they are doing now is lying. You cannot call a plan ""unlimited"" when it is  clearly not. Also, I don't think that I called more than 30 different numbers, which for me is normal use (not sure though how many calls I made exactly). How many numbers are allowed on your ""unlimited"" plan?

                I have been using Rebtel for a couple of months now and I had recommended a friend to use the app because it was good but now I am regretting for doing that! First, my subscription got canceled for whatever reason. I emailed them about the matter and it's been weeks now and they haven't replied and said nothing! And since I really needed to call internationally and didn't have time to find another app I could use to make international calls, I had to buy the World credit wich only gave me 60 minutes for $10. But that didn't work out so well either  because when I would place a call, it redirected to other people's number where each time I would make a call it would go to different country, and I now this because they would speak a different language each time I made a call. So, I am very disappointed.

                When you pay for subscription they store your card details and charge you every month without sending any alert. So if someone forgets they have a subscription and dont check there bank account. They will be charged every month without getting any notification (email). Thief's...

                Updated review as at 09/07/17:<br>- Further to my last review, Rebtel continued to drop my calls despite charging me for an unlimited minute. They keep using this call dropping technique so that I use less minutes, it's shameless and stupid company who has no understanding about the customer service.  <br><br>Updated review as at 30/06/17:<br>- Further to my review on 17/06/17, I hereby provide some new updates regarding the service i have been receiving from fraudulent co. Just to make it clear, I have took a subscription for an unlimited calls to Bangladesh for a monthly 9.99 pounds which Rebtel increased to 24.99 because they said I am using too many minutes (well thats why i have an unlimited subscription). Anyhow, I still carried on with the subscription despite their awful call quality and customer service.<br>However, since 28/06/17, I could no longer make a call to bangladesh and they have blocked a number that I call!  When enquired, after complaining several times, they bombarded me with their robotic message, finally Mark Louie from customer service said,'Hello Mr..Tanks for contacting and patience in reaching us! The number has been flagged due to an abnormal use far above what is determined, as normal use, by our system! Calls to that number will be resumed in 7 days. Thanks for understanding!'<br>- Now, I pay for an unlimited phone calls, mainly to one person. I pay a premium for this service 24.99/month. It's not Rebtel to determine how many mins I speak when I have an unlimited subscription for a very premium charge!<br>- I would have stopped using service of this crook but I think these corporate thugs getting away with these malpractices with many other customer. So my mission is to push these criminals out of the telecommunication market!<br><br><br>Updated review as at 17/06/17:<br>-Further to my earlier review, I intent to provide some further update regarding the awful service Rebtel provide. I will shed lights on the call quality, call drops and feedback/help  I have received from Rebtel when complained about the service. <br>-I used to have a subscription for unlimited calls to Bangladesh, however, Rebtel increased the monthly subscription from ¬£9.99 to ¬£20.99 when I provided negative review about the co and its awful service. <br>- Despite the increase in monthly charge, I still use Rebtel, however every ten/fifteen minutes my calls are dropped, when I complain, they email me a robotic message which goes on to say ""<br>Hi MR, <br>My name is Sophie and I work with customer satisfaction at Rebtel. I noticed that you just rated your last call with 1 out of 5 stars on its quality. <br>Something didn't work for you and I want to understand why.

                it is expensive to call my country Nigeria. I wonder why the contry cannot be grouped with the countries that have unlimited calls. Many of my friends left Rebtel; but will be happy to come back if more minutes are added or giving the unlimited calls.<br>I hope you could look into this. I like using Rebtel, but since I am retired, it is hard for me to spend too much to call my families. I have limited callings because I cannot afford it.

                The service is a rip off.  It was reliable and trustworthy until about 2 months ago, then it became a joke. There are so many issues, including variable call quality, dropping calls but the biggest issue is  auto connections via a credit card, even when you cancel the card. I spent almost ¬£150  , when I would normally spend about ¬£40 just because they changed the system so that even though you have credits they take money via the phone when you dial, even if you cancel auto top up. The  staff 'investigate' but came back with woolly explainations that don't explain how the system has recently changed. Do not ever use your credit card wth these bandits, as even if you cancel they still retain your details and will charge you for connecting or making a call without any sensible reasoning. I will never trust them again and will be reporting them to trading standards.

But I logged into my account and had ¬£19.22 in credit.

                Call quality - Average<br>Be Careful while you do the subscription... their website is dodgy, you might have unsubscribed the deal but you will be charged money. <br>Secondly, they have a useless subscription called 'World Credits' which charges you more than the prevalent deals for specific countries. <br>When you opt for recharge over phone, you will not be subscribed to your preferred country deal rather be parked on World Credit. You will keep talking on that useless world credit subscription which will get as it is outside the deal. <br><br>This is a clear cut unethical practice by Rebtel and monopoly. I am waiting for a competitor to come on board to switch over soon.

I used Skype premium service for years and frustrated about call dropout and poor connection. Also this is the only VoIP (so far I know) that works without internet. I recommended many friends and they are happy to. @Rebtel, it will be great if you guys reduce the cost in future. Thanks

                They have the worst customer support. To find a way to get to them takes away all your patience. I am a new customer and trying to redeem a voucher. Also I closed my account with G3 telecom services to sign up with rebtel. I used 2 vouchers and none of them worked. I was without any telecom services for about a day and I had to call my parents in India. They provide expired codes to our company maybe so that people like us would sign up for an account and then bam! That is it, you don't get any credit against that voucher. I had to flip through the FAQs, read help articles and then they thought they had their fun so after 15 minutes of struggle the website gave me chat option. I still wasn't losing faith in them. I talked to an agent and he was rude and absurd. I even told him how important it was for me to make a call to India. He was totally helpless and I don't even think how to treat customers. He didn't even what I was talking about! When I thought he is not helping me out, I rated him 1 star and ended the conversation. He came back to me saying I was rude for giving him 1 star and that he was thinking of giving me some credit. That was unacceptable since I did not want to talk to him and ended the chat, he had no right to reopen the chat and send me messages. Also there is technically no way that you can end a chat except by closing out the website!!! I would suggest them to hire more polite reps and also train them to help us out better.

The only problem is that after the brexit results with the pounds tumbling against the dollar their prices have gone up. It used to be 40p per minute but now 53p per minute. Still cheaper than the others, I think this is because they still rely on Etecsa on the other end.

I have unused credits on my line, made a call to Serbia and they blocked my app, I tried every means to reopen my app and it kept saying it will send a verification code to my phone, that never happened, then I got an email from the support team who started asking me why I called Serbia? Really? Who's f**king business is it with who I call? If it is a problem, why not go ahead and record the call or take some security measure, I have always used this service to make international calls so what has a business call to Serbia got to do with blocking my account and holding my call credit? Sorry they just lost one and I will forever give them bad reviews on multiple platforms to make them loose more people because any company that don't respect or regard their customers don't deserve to be in business.

                Honestly I never had such a haunting experience with any service provider. I was told about Rebtel by my friend and I googled Rebtel Website. The welcome page says Unlimited Calls to India and Try One week free. I created an account on Nov 8th 2:25 PM hence I was eligible under free trial until Nov 15th. I decided to continue hence a payment of $10 was deducted from my card on 15th November. I made numerous calls from November 8th till yesterday to India but got a shock of my life when T-Mobile Service Provider sent me a hefty bill for all those calls. They told all those calls were made using their Network Towers. I emailed Rebtel Immediately since deliberately there is no customer care number given to call. Another shock I got when a customer care Representative told me that my free trial was expired on same day of activation i.e November 8th and it is reactivated on Nov 15 so now you can make calls. I told about my whole experience and the way he replied was very insensitive and unprofessional.

                Hi Everyone  .i am from paris . i am sharing my experience using rebtel .i am using rebtel for about more than 6 months. i used to call india under the scheme unlimited ,charged 10 Euro by rebtel valid for 30 days . <br><br>But what i found is , i could not  able to make call more than 8 TO 10 unique numbers .That means ! the numbers you are accesing are limited . if you try accessing more than this a voice message will inform you that ¬®you have crossed the limitation of unique numbers¬® . so it is clear that you cannot call more random numbers in an unlimited scheme but you can call unlimited to your limited numbers means numbers you used to talk frequently. And Rebtel did not mention this properly  when they advertising as ¬®Hijacking real phone lines to liberate international calling¬® or ¬®cheap as hell ¬® in their website .And their is no even any official customer contact or support for Rebtel. If you had to face any Real time  issues . You need to mail them about it  . i wonder why ? but may rebtel  still using 1 gen computers .<br>Rebtel is just a shiityy cheat as hell like other cheap vendors like ringo !! instead of using this i just now shifted to lebara cards which they provide a separate sim , providing 5000 min under 5 euro .And freely accessible to unique numbers and also has a unlimited date validity .

                I've used Rebtel for many years and was always happy with their service but for the last few months EVERY call I make is dropped (I see other reviewers are complaining about this happening too) and a recording states ""if you want to call your friend back ‚Ä¶"".  Based on the current service I'd only given them one star but because it was a great company in the past I've upped it to two stars however if this problem continues then I guess it's time to find a new provider.

                What  happened to  Rebtel? I used to get more time from my deal to call Nigeria but now it seems indirectly the bill more minutes  than the actual call. They found  away squeeze more and more money out  of  users. It's been  nice.

                Rebtel is unethical, corrupt and grredy.<br>Rebtel has been charging my bank account automatically and withdrawing  $10 each time, for over $150.<br>There is no contact phone number to reach the customer service to make a complaint. After sending email explaining the situation I get a reply that the balance on my card has a total credit of $3.79, so she will return back the the $3.79 back into my bank account. <br><br>Rebtel includes unethical business practices.

                I've used Rebtel to phone my family in South Africa for many years now. It's always been ultra cheap, reliable and easy to use. This year however the line continually drops out although we share a strong signal. Now, every few minutes a voice will inexplicably cut in with useless offers of free calls to friends and I have to phone through again. If I phone not using Rebtel yes it's extremely expensive but at least I get a complete call experience and not phone roulette. Come on Rebtel! Coincidently it's gone downhill when you changed your logo and aptly put a woman screaming in frustration on your Facebook cover page!? (Lol)

                I find Rebtel to be easy to use and it has a clear connection.  One drawback is difficulty in paying for credit.  There was a promotion advertised and shown on the website but it wouldn't allow me to take advantage of it.  I had to go ahead and add credit using the normal method and wasn't able to take advantage of the promotion.

                This company absolutely has no value for you as a customer. It is evident from the fact that they don't even have a customer care number. I have been using their service from few months. I recently found out that they have started charging me twice from last couple of months. Last month, I reached out to them asking why i was charged twice and they said, sorry, it was their system error and they cant refund, instead i can use their service for the amount they charged me. Which means I only wanted 30 days of service and they forced me 60 days service by charging twice. They also said, this won't repeat. I removed my credit card details and added a new credit card so that, they wont use my old credit card to charge twice again. Just found they have again charged me twice on the new credit card. I really don't know what to do with these guys . I mean they is a limit to which you can be so careless about customer service. It when a company starts acting like thugs extracting money without permission, you start thinking such companies dont have a right to exist.<br>Response to your reply: I do not use facebook. Here is my ticket number #960798. I don't think you care. From the past three days, I am receiving the same response from you. which is "" the payment was made, sorry we can't refund but if you choose to use the service you are charged for you can"". I am planing to ask my bank to mark you as fraud because if I did't do it, you will charge me again next month twice without my permission and if that happens next month, I am filing a complaint with US Bureau  of Consumer Protection

                Avoid unless you enjoy being scammed!!!<br>Would give zero stars if it was an option. Ordered $10 credit for 1000 minutes. First day I called and used 20 minutes it went to 980 mins. Second day I called the same number and for 20 minutes went from 980 to 718 minutes. Unless they changed the rate from 1c to 7c overnight there is no explanation. And just checked: It still @ 1c and use within one year for new customers. Once you sign and become a customer for one day the gimmicks begin.

I have subscribed unlimited plan, but every month my called phone number's reached certain figure, they won't allow me to make a call to new numbers, why? you should not restrict me to call certain numbers only, if u do so, then don't call it is unlimited plan.. then what is the meaning of unlimited plan?<br><br>Always i'm hearing ringing even the receiver end phone switched off or not reachable or busy and there is no feedback about that. pls improve that..

                They have given advertisement on the web to call india 10$ for One month and 7 days. Opened the account on 3rd July and fed my credit card details on my Rebtel account then they gave a link to download their APPS but the beauty is that Link did not work and tried for two weeks to download their apps meanwhile they have taken 10USD from my account even though you were not using their services and No customer service number also but when i chatting thru Customer support, did not get proper solution after downloaded their application in two weeks, just used their service only two days, On next day when i am calling to India, says no enough credit to call India, approached customer support  why i could not make call? do you know what they said<br>	<br>Cathy<br>Do you have a credit on  your local phone plan?<br><br>I have taken a look at your account and I see no apparent reason why you are unable to call.<br>The first thing we kindly ask you is to make sure that you have enough credit on your phone (not on the Rebtel account); Since you have to pay for the local call to our numbers with your local minutes while the international cost of the call is deducted from your prepaid Rebtel credit.<br><br>Why i should pay my local numbers, then i realised, i am completely cheated by them

                Overall good experience with Rebtel. They have a good service and good quality of voice.<br><br>Only improvements required are : REBTEL should have some customer care number where we can talk and share our issues. Though they have email address for customer care. Sometimes (I really mean sometimes - once in a six month) you may not be able to connect using REBTEL and in case if you have emergency, you need backup calling mechanism. They are reply very fast on email, though.

                If you are new to Rebtel, please do NOT use it. I used to recommend it to my friends, but I will NEVER do that again. There are so many other options out there. It might cost you a bit more, but you can stay out of future trouble.<br><br>In my case, I could no longer to log in from my mobile app since they turned their logo upside down. It's been months. Thanks to Google, I was able to find out their well buried 'Report a Problem' button and send a few messages. At first, I received replies with staff's names listed in the end of the messages, though the replies are not for my issues, or just a product of 'copy and paste' in my opinion. As it went on, I could only receive automatic replies generated by system itself. As for now, I filled another web form days ago, no response, even from a machine, yet.<br><br>Their new logo is shiny, so is their new website.

                While Call quality most of the times is good, Rebtel as app needs some major improvements which are available in other apps.<br>1. No Support for Bluetooth headsets.<br>2. Call disconnects if there is any voice call while on Rebtel call, this happens only with Rebtel and not other voip apps.<br>3. When calling through Rebtel, you always hear rings even if its not ringing at other line, no way to know if other party's ph is switched off, not reachable, busy, call waiting etc...<br><br>Above features are readily available on other voip apps like Nymgo, not sure why Rebtel team has not taken care of these...

                My complaint is regarding Rebtel VOIP provider.<br><br>Rebtel is a VOIP provider (they provide affordable calls to international numbers) with local access numbers.<br><br>First you register (with your own telephone number from your country) for their service, buy a minimal credit of 5‚Ç¨ + EU tax, and then you enter an international number you wish to call, and Rebtel gives you an local number. When you call this local number that Rebtel gave you (you can only call it from your own number that you register with), Rebtel will connect you with an international number you wish to call.<br><br>Like I said, first you need to register (enter it to Rebtel system via web interface) your own number (from wich you will be calling) and also that international number that you wish to call.<br><br>Everything went well and everything was O.K. for first 100 minutes, which they charged me per minute at their calling rate price. Then Rebtel start to make this harassments and demands to tell them what is this number that I am calling (it was just one Estonian mobile number), to whom this number belongs, and why am I calling just and only this number (?!).<br><br>Also they suspended my account (I can not make calls anymore, although I still have valid balance, and I paid for this service upfront), telling me that it is for my own protection. I do not understand why, as I registered all numbers in their system, and I paid for this service, therefor, I should call whoever I want. But Rebtel thinks that I should explain to them why am I calling this number, and who is the owner of this Estonian mobile number that I was calling! Outrageous!<br><br>Also, I recomended several of my friends (because until now I was really satisfied with the quality of their service and price), and one of them got suspended also!<br><br>When they suspend you, you got an automatic e-mail telling you that you are suspended, and you can not login, or make new calls even if you have balance and you paid for this service upfront. You have to write them and ask why they suspended you and why you can not use this service that you paid for, then you have to wait for their answer, and then this harrassment started.<br><br>I believe that I did not done anything wrong, I registered and paid for this service, I was calling Estonian mobile number and they charged me per minute at their calling rate price. But, as I said, after 100 minutes they suspended my account and started to harassment me with these questions and asked me to provide them with some informations that was not their concern.<br><br>I paid for the service, they charged me, and therefore, I should call whoever I want, even this is one Estonian number, without explaining myself to anyone. I did not done anything wrong. But no, they suspended my account and they started to harassment me.<br><br>My friend has also the same problem. We selected Rebtel as they have the most affordable calling rates for Estonia, and they provided you with local number to call. So it was really affordable, and I would (and I did!) recommended Rebtel to anyone, but then this started.<br><br>So I writting this complaint to let everyone know what did Rebtel done and what can you expect from Rebtel.

                Seems like Rebtel are engaged in an completely unfair business practice to dupe the customers.<br>They don't give customers any option to enroll into any auto debit option during subscription renewal or take any consent from the customers to charge the linked credit cards. They charged my credit card 10 USD automatically without my consent and their customer support is saying it is by default enabled and I had to manually go inside and search from where that option is and disable the same during each subscription renewal!! They say as per their policy charged amount can not be disabled!! So policy also made to dupe customers. <br><br>How come charging customers linked credit card be a default option without customer's consent..is it not grossly unfair and shabby?!<br><br>After reading some similar experiences from other customers here, I got confirmed this is Rebtel's tricks to siphon out money from unsuspecting customers!!

Belligerence of customer service to do anything except write emails amounting to ""it's you who are at fault for our overbilling, do this, do that etc., et.,. Rebtel has no understanding of their billing process with credit card issuers. No more patience for this kindergarten operation. Turned over to AM EX to handle all.<br><br>Signed up for service, started at $5.00 per month to Eastern Europe.  Fee changed to who knows what since they don't want to say.  Incurred 3 charges of $25 x 3 ($75) in 1 month .  Called AM EX to challenge the extra costs, Rebtel locked my service and said they wouldn't do anything until I ""undisputed"" the charges.  Customer non service service doesn't seem to understand English based on the nonsensical answers that does not address the issues, much less  provide customer service.

                Its very convenient especially with the local voice call that require no WiFi or internet for long distance call. Also the improvement they made in the app is great as I don't have to call a special number to have my calls connected. I call a lot and in fact use 600 minutes to call Nigeria  in less than a week but its so worth it because the call quality is super good, there are few glitches sometimes though but for an international call its not too bad. Also the call connects even if the other party's phone is switched off this is very bad And am taking a star out for that. It made me think my fianc√©e was quarrelling with me and won't pick up her phone whereas her phone was completely off because she couldn't charge he phone. Also my credit got deducted for those dials about 20min plus because I continued dialing and each dial lasted 2 mins each which really made me mad. well am over it now. Let's continue with the review: an improvement I will like is for them to make the app recognizable as a calling app so that I can just connect without  going to the rebtel app every time.

                I am working in US and my family is in India. Previously, I used to call my family using other calling card providers and there rates were wat more than Rebtel. The quality was also not good as compared to Rebtel. The most important part with Rebtel is your call goes with the same number you are calling unlike other cheap calling cards. Voice clarity is pretty good in case of Rebtel. There are few instances where we have issues but Rebtel keep on asking the review of call and provides us better quality next time. Thanks Rebtel team for providing such a awesome service.

I have asked RebTel to clarify this matter for me and also either refund the second payment or advise me of an alternative. <br><br>I've advised RebTel that if I don't get a response pertaining the payments I will be forced to contact my bank/credit provider and advise them to cancel the relevant payments!!<br><br>I assured RebTel of my continued attention with relation to these matters but still have had NO RESPONSE!!!<br><br>By the comments I have read here on TrustPilot it appears as though RebTel's reputation leaves a lot to be desired!!!<br><br>It saddens me greatly to say this but  if you value your time and money then avoid this company at all costs!

                I wanted to make calls to Nigeria, and when I Google searched for how to do that I found rebtel. I quickly paid for 260 mins and refered my friend to use their service. Normally, I can't make international calls directly from my phone but after paying i could. I expended 260 mins and got a bill of more than $1000 from my network provider as rebtel was not covering the calls. I felt they broke the trust because the fiduciary responsibility of a company is not just to collect money but to also provide information on how to use their services.<br>I contacted them to see how they can offer any assistance to me but they washed their hands off my case and wouldn't bother to offer any assistance. I am now $1000 in debt all because I trusted rebtel to provide the service they were meant to provide and give directions...

                Hello everyone, <br>I would like to aware all of you about this app. Rebtel deducting money twice a month and they'll use ur credit card info without ur consent and when u gonna look into credit card history, it will be shocking that you hav charged for 14-14 US$ twice a month and they will not gonna give gou refund and they don't even have customer service representatives and contact, where you can call to resolve this issue. <br>And they are not apologetic at all for this kind of scam. And if you go and check their website, whoever used this app once, became victim of overcharging. <br>Moreover, they're being racist. This is what I personally noticed. As, they are ruling this app from US, bcoz they are charging us in U.s. $. <br>If they see, you are either Indian, Pakistani (which one can easily recognize from our name), they'll never ever offer you refund for those fake payments and overpayments. Please be careful and if you still wanna use this app, keep an eye on ur account. <br>If, m the only one, who hav this problem. Then I could b wrong. But there are so many people who have addressed this issue and Rebtel isn't resolving it. <br>Worse and poor app. Basically, they are stealing ur money and account privacy. For them, Rebtel is another form of theft. <br>Ridiculous service and app !

                Update 12 Nov 2017<br><br>Updating my earlier review by further downgrading it. I have allowed a week for Rebtel customer service to respond, during which period I made two attempts to get assistance. <br> <br>The new problem: I have not been able to get any calls through. My contacts tell me that they have received no calls from me whatsoever. Meanwhile, Rebtel has been charging me for the time I spend on the line, while waiting - not talking. The complete unresponsiveness on the side of the customer service has convinced me I will stop using Rebtel after I run down my credit. <br><br>Old update: after back-and-forth messages with the customer service - I should point out that they assigned a different agent per email - I have received a compensation. Mind you, this only came about after days of having to explain and pressurizing their customer service agents.<br><br>When you order a $10 meal off of a menu in a restaurant, how much do you expect to pay for it when you ask for the bill? In normal state of affairs,  you'd pay the price listed in the menu. But the same logic does not apply to Rebtel's service, which I found out through a first-hand experience. <br><br>I come from Uzbekistan, and was pleased to learn that I could stay in touch with my family as Rebtel seemingly offered a very attractive rate to call numbers in the country: 0.023 EUR per minute. However, after a few calls it came to my attention that I was running out of credit way too quickly. Upon reviewing my activity log, I was disturbed to learn that the company had charged me between 0.23 to 1.34 EUR per minute on different calls to the exact same numbers. That is 10 and 58 times the rate which is indicated on the app - 0.023 EUR/min - which also conveniently shows up before I made the each call.  <br><br>I quote from the customer service response to my inquiry regarding this matter: ""I can assure you that we wanted to keep the same rates, but we were forced to increase them due to capacity issues and to be able to sustain the same level of quality.""<br><br>Going back to the restaurant comparison: in a similar scenario to the one I am experiencing with Rebtel, you'd be paying anywhere between $100 to $580 for the $10 meal you had ordered. And you would find that out only after you had eaten the damn food. The server would kindly inform you that ""due to capacity issues"" the meal you just ate got much more expensive now - so deal with it. <br><br>No restaurant would be allowed to continue conducting business in this fraudulent manner, and neither should any company. Avoid this service if you do not feel like dealing with multiple customer service agents just to get your money back.

                I have never been treated so badly by any service. I have been a customer with Rebtel for 6 years and never had cause to worry till April, 23rd 2010. They took money from my account (supposedly my monthly subscription charge) without an email or adding minutes to my account. I had a monthly subscription and it was all going well. I would get an email immediately it's gone through and also have the minutes loaded into my Rebtel account.<br>My bank on the other hand has never alerted me of a fraud purchase but for this purchase they did. First thing I did before confirming it was a fraud was to check my inbox for an email and also my Rebtel account for the minutes purchased but to my bewilderment, there was no email sent, neither was there $15 worth minutes added to my account so I responded a ""no"" to my bank. It was a type yes or no answer if you recognize that purchase and an email or the purchased minutes in question, I didn't recognize that purchase.<br>Rebtel went ahead to restrict my access to my account. I have not been able to use the $9 worth of minutes I already had in my account for almost two weeks.<br>They clearly showed great detest stating that I should have notified them first before notifying my bank. I went to great lengths explaining to them that <br>- this had never happened, <br>- I didn't go to my bank, they reached out to me <br>- I waited for hours to receive their email to confirm the payment,<br>- I also asked them to check their records and see that I never got an email confirmation of my payment as is always the case.<br>- I also said my minutes weren't added. <br>They sent me emails insisting it was there. I have sent over 6 emails to them explaining but they have told me they will not give me access to my account unless I call my bank and admit the charge, get them to provide a written letter stating it was not a fraud and sent the letter to me. <br>My entire friends and family who have also been in Rebtel for over 7 years are shocked.<br>I have never been backmailed in my life and to think that I would betray my person considering also the services my bank provides me in protecting my account is just beyond me.<br>Rebtel is basically punishing me for refusing to be blackmailed. <br>After over 6 years of being on this service why would I jump up to create a dispute if they were no grounds? It was a clear fraud and I feel bad I have recommended them to all my family and friends in US and the UK? And for $15? I guess a smart way is to make me loose my $9 as well.<br>Never leave your account details on file here if you want to keep enjoying this service.

                I tried out Rebtel and was pleased with the result. I recommended the company to friends and family. All seems fine until there is a problem. On this occasion I credited my account using the  Paypal option. Rebel did not give me the credit - while I could see from Paypal that they had been paid. I contacted Rebel - they told me that they could not see any error on their part and asked for more details. I sent Rebel my Paypal receipt = no answer. I chased them up = no answer. I went to Paypal and filed a dispute. Rebel immediately suspended my account and sent me an automated message. I replied to Rebel = no answer.<br>UPDATE - this was finally sorted. Rebel acknowledge that there was a problem the day I credited my account and have dealt with this. Further they say that they know the customer service bit of theurwebsite is poor and they are trying to improve. I continued to have problems communicating but finally used the Facebook route and things were sorted immediately.

                As mentioned in previous reviews this company seem to think it is OK to change their call pricing after you paid for their service and without any prior notification. <br><br>After submitting a request for a refund I got a reply telling me that they are doing their best to keep the prices but are forced to increase them due to capacity issues and to be able to sustain the same level of quality. <br><br>This the worst case of cheating the customer as the money is taken upfront and the terms are changed after. Is done so sneakily - without notifying the customer as well. <br><br>The amount I have given these people is not much, but I feel disgusted by such enterprises which feel can do this and hide behind their T&amp;Cs (which I am sure they have for this type of situation). <br><br>I hope that this review will discourage people from using this service as there are plenty of alternatives. <br><br>I will see what my options are in terms of consumer rights and will take this up with Google Play support.

                Hi folks,  please stay away from this company. I am a new rebtel client. Prices per min changing so quick and by huge difference on this platform. For example when I topped up by fiver on the day it showed my balance 200 min to one European country mobiles,  After three days showed only 8 min available. Price sky rocketing per min from 2,5c to 35c. Mad increased in price without any notification. I dont understand how this can happen??  This is  a joke or scam or what??? Also on the day i been offerd subscription unlimited calls for 7$per month to one european country. Now I dont see any subscription available particulary for that country at all. What I noticed  this crowd working so tricky and fools the people. They advertising and promoting product/service for one price, but at the end consumer gets absolutely different price. This matter  should be reported to consumer protection authorities this absolutely ilegal to act in the way they does. They should be sued for breaching consumer rights. My advice is  shop around for better service. THANKS

Of course I haven't even opened my own Facebook profile in years, how would I know, so I make calls unknowingly that Rebtel is not working. Mind you, voice system says everything it says on any other normal day, ""Welcome to Rebel please enter the international number you want to call'"" etc. So I call, I have topped up my account with about 500 minutes so I'm not even worried. I make my usual calls, to all my relatives, friends unknowingly. The next day I find out that instead of charging my Rebtel account as was supposed to happen all the calls (now I know it was due to their connectivity issues) of course AT&amp;T picked them all up and now I had a $400 bill. After five days of trying to contact them, I wind up having to contact them through Facebook, and they end up saying oh we don't see any of your calls on our logs, well of course if your system was actually down you aren't going to see anything. Then they say we'll give you $20 credit as a sign of good faith. $400, $20 , good faith? Come on now. And then they try hide behind the issue of not interfering with third parties, no this is about how your system fooled me. At this point it's not even about just the bill, the emotional toll all this has taken on me is included. My email is tequiladube@ yahoo.com for anyone who wants more evidence against these thieves, or just wants to see proof about the monster I'm advising against.

                I liked their call quality but I could not recharge my account just all over sudden. Money was deducted from my account and still could not connect to their service. I contacted rebtel but I did not receive any reply. I was a loyal customer and deleted that account and opened another account. Two days down the line, I had the same exact issue. This time round I decided enough was enough and opted for another service.

                I contacted Rebtel support about having a concern and was promptly replied in under 25 minutes. I then explained the concern and I have not been replied in 4 days. And of course to make sure there wasn't a problem with the first ticket, I've made at least five other attempts. It's almost like Rebtel picked up their business and ran away. But no it's still up and running just ignoring me. I've never been more annoyed.

                I have been using Rebtel for more than 5 years now.  About call quality, price - I have absolutely no complaint.  It was a smooth experience, until sometime in January 2016, when all changed.  Rebtel changed their website ‚Äì for the worst possible experience for the customers.  I couldn‚Äôt access my account after successful login, and contacted the customer service on Feb 3rd of 2016. I received email from the support telling me how they can see I have logged in (after I have already mentioned that I could login and unable to access my account).  And then started emails every other day, suggesting me to try other browser, deleting cookies etc. ‚Äì one email ‚Äì one suggestion.  It took exactly 14 days for the issue to be fixed by their technical team.  <br>Now the new saga ‚Äì can‚Äôt edit my local numbers or add any other.  I contacted the customer service again.  After several emails, when I mentioned I only 19 local numbers and I am allowed 20, I get this email that I have 20 ‚Äì now I have sent them screenshots.  I thought companies strive to get better ‚Äì never thought will find one that is trying and achieving to get worse by leaps and bounds until Rebtel.  This is a prime example of what a customer service should never be.

                I came to know the new policy while using my Deal ""unlimited call Package for India"". I tried to call a number and i heard the message that its not possible to call on this number as you have exceeded calling the Unique Numbers. I never know about this rule. In my view this is a CHEATING and Rebtel should tell about this policy in starting. Customer can then decide whether they wants to purchase the deal or. they can decide that which  number is under priority and all.

                I downloaded Rebtel on my iPhone to call my boyfriend in Cuba. To be fair for the last three years I have been using google voice and Cuballama both of which have dropped calls, and sometimes it's almost impossible to hear eachother - as seems to be the case for most Cuban communications. I had high hopes having read the reviews on using Rebtel to call Cuba and getting crystal clear connections. So far: most of the time when I call it doesn't even ring on his end, and it eventually (1.5 min or more of ringing) it takes me to a message from Verizon (my carrier) saying the call couldn't be completed. Once in a while it connects perfectly and I can hear him very well - the best so far. He can not hear me as well, one time he got clear reception of my voice. My problem is the few times we have successfully connected, a few minutes into the conversation it drops the call and then I cannot get it to connect to him again no matter how many times I try to reconnect. It's so frustrating. I usually cannot get it to ring through to him again until the next day - and then again only once and only for about 10 minutes before it drops the call and won't reconnect. Like I said I had high hopes. ;(

                I have been using Rebtel for about two years now and to be honest, did this out of laziness on my part to find another provider but having spoken with a few friends now, done with Rebtel for following reasons:-<br>1. Too Expensive: - in this day and age when there are apps for calling for free and clearly, there simply is no justification for such high prices for calls.<br>2. Despite length of time using rebtel, you would think there would be special loyalty discounts to those of us who have used their services for such extended periods. In this day and age where every business is finding ways of rewarding customer loyalty and offering all sorts, it seems all Rebtel is about, is people using its services and loyalty does not factor into the equation. Why then should anyone want to continue with such an organization if benefits are one-sided!!

                My provider in Belgium (Telenet) have charged me for all the calls I have made via 2  deals to South AfricaI purchased via REBTEL.  Calls which should have cost me ‚Ç¨23,80 have now been charged to me for the amount of ‚Ç¨361,10. My provider have rejected my request for investigation that the calls were made via a REBTEL contact number as on the REBTEL  site. I have subsequently mailed Rebtel and am waiting for an answer.   I cannot believe this has happened and have requested they pay my provider (refund me) for the costs incurred.  Just getting my money back that I have paid via credit card to REBTEL is not an option as the purchase was made in good faith so that I could call cheaply to South Africa.   I hope there is a procedure for REBTEL  to take their full responsibility for this problem as they have reputable reviews which I checked at length before signing up for their service.  I advise that REBTEL remove deals from their website to avoid other people becoming victims of the same fate as it is for a reason we use REBTEL. NOT to be charged by our providers. January I used REBTEL via a contact number in Brussels to contact South Africa and my provider did not charge me.  February they charged me for every call made.  I sent 2 mails to REBTEL support last night with  proof of my bill from my provider clearly stating the number I called was the number given on the site as a the contact number for the country I was calling which was +27 87 550 23 47;  and will have to wait the 48 hours it will take to get an answer. I hope REBTEL contact my provider to sort this out as there is nowhere I can find a telephone number for customer service as everything has to be done by mail.  I hope and trust REBTEL will  solve this as it a very unpleasant experience. I have always had good response from Patricia at customer service.  In the meantime do not make any calls using a REBTEL contact number in your destination country.  Your provider will charge you full price.  Now is the time for me and for all of us  to really rate REBTEL on their customer service and solving this problem.   It is when things go wrong that the reviews really count.  I will keep everyone posted on progress in this matter.

                Rebtel offers good quality calls with a nice mobile application and choice of subscriptions.  However, my main concerns using the service are as follows:<br>1.  It only offers payments through credit cards, I don't feel comfortable sharing my card information.  Rebtel should offer more secure features like PayPal.<br>2.  The calls are not the cheapest in the market (especially when you use Pay and Go without subscribing to a plan).<br>3.  On a number of occasions I have noticed that although you hear the phone ringing on the other end, it actually doesn't start ringing before a number of rings i.e. there is a delay in connecting the call.<br><br>Hope it helps.

                Hi there,<br>I had been using the Vonage service from United States to call my people in Asia-India and elsewhere, Australia or Dubai, Malaysia and Singapore though it was little expensive(every month charge will be fixed, 40-50$).<br>However, I was disconnected from the network and I was looking for a cheap method to call India , from my cell phone itself. I had been seeing Rebtel ads but, I was initially apprehensive to use a new and unknown network and also was concerned about the reliability, money transactions etc. But, once I set up my account with the phone number, I found the ease of using it-U can set up local numbers for the international numbers you want to contact and also, dial in from the app whenever necessary, if u want to call any new no that is not stored.So, this is the first advantage. Secondly, they have quite a wide range of plans-depending on fixed and variable talk times. Also, the cost of using it is much reduced(for me, more than 3 times lesser) than the usual methods. If you use any other carrier /network like AT&amp;T, I see their costs are always lil higher-about 5-10$ more for unlimited calls/mins.<br>So, this way, these are the 2 main reasons, I would continue to use Rebtel for international calling, after my current 2 months usage.<br>Also, I had an account registered on an earlier number which is not in service now. I was charged for the 2nd month cycle but, basically it was my mistake not to have deleted the account since, I forgot the pin. Later, one support representative has been kind enough to at least help me with deleting or not charging me for my old account. Only one thing, since, this company works out of Luxembourg, they delay a lil by a day or 2 while responding to ur customer service mails. But, they at least reply and are prompt in doing and trying to solve any issues.<br>One more point is this service is available in UK, Dubai, Africa and other variety of places. They can may be expand their horizon.<br>Good job. Happy customer...till now..!!! Congrats..and continue this way..<br>Thanks

                I usually go for subscription renewal through Thor automated system, I never had to explicitly choose that I need unlimited india calling, I did that once in October or November manually, since then every month it's their automated system which renews the same plan, but after they revamped their site the automated system chose world credits instead of unlimited plan. I contacted customer service it's never ending conversation, there is no way to call them everything is through email and for every email they'll take 2 days to reply. When I reported this they said it was my fault. If it was my fault why would I contact them in the first place. If there was an option to give zero rating I would have given zero for their customer service.

                I have used a variety of calling cards to call India from US. Each one I discontinued after a few months because of either call drops, unusual price hike, bad call quality, delay etc. but ever since I started using Rebtel I have not had any problem big enough to stop using it. It is very dependable and has the best user interface for both android and apple. For less than $10 a month for unlimited it offers the best rates I have seen. This is my honest review. If you are looking for a good calling card I will definitely recommend this.

                Rebtel is a horrid company. Not only can you not contact them, they are non-responsive with issues, did not follow through when I finally got tot them, have not heard back when I filed a poor customer survey and I am STILL being charged monthly for a service I have tried to cancel 2 times. There is no way to do this from their virtually non-functioning website, which only works if you want to GIVE them money.

                Rebtel has some of the best prices to call to Cuba and I will stick with them.  The communication and sound are good.  However, it is very disappointing that they will round off your time to the following minute.   You spoke 5 minutes and 1 second, and this will count as 6 minutes used.  Long distance fees are high enough as they are, I wish they would count the real time spent on the phone.  If one calls oftens, a couple of minutes can be lost that way.  Otherwise it is good.

                Rebtel service I can only rate for their service to Cuba which is the location were I call to only. Their service to cuba is ok but the feature that would not allow you to recharge multiple times is very dishearting when you are in an important conversacion and you are suddently cut off, and when you try to recharge you are inform that you have reach the maximun times that you can recharge for that day which is only one. Very terrible for both parties in the conversation.

This not at all acceptable double price.<br><br>And i would like bring one more thing. Unlimited Calls to India 10$/Month. You guys no where mentioned about How many phone numbers allowed to dail (I came to know 33 phone numbers only allowed from my Rebtel friend). if it crossed 33 phone numbers i mean 34 phone number automatic voice saying you are exceed call number for this month. in this case if anything urgent call to india? i am gone case.<br><br>So i will look for another application depends on your reply.<br><br>Thanks<br>rameshreddy.emani$gmail.com<br>+91-9686 597 354

Having said that, there is certainly room for improvement as follows:<br><br>1) Update the windows phone app to provide the same features as its android and ios apps<br>2) call made via local rebtel number can have a significant lag and echo ( one hears ones own voice)<br><br>If the above are implemented then its a 5 star service.

Their systems do not work and when you tell them, they say it is not their fault, but when you have already cancelled your subscription and they charge you for the next month. You have to re cancel the subscription, which then they focus on that date not on the date you first cancelled the service when you contact them.

So if you require a cheap method of calling overseas, this is the perfect app.<br><br>In saying this, there are some few relatively simple, but MAJOR improvements needed... namely the first is that when you call, the screen DOES NOT turn off. Meaning that often you'll accidentally touch the 'end call' option or mute it. Its INCREDIBLY annoying<br><br>Morever, when selecting the 'Data and Wifi' option of the app setup, be wary as it only uses the Data, not wifi.. even when there is wifi variable.

                Rebtel has made it easy for me to connect with friends and family back home.

It's always clear, and even if the call disconnects you don't loose all your money. They even give you a local number to associate every international number so calling family and friends is a direct line, not ""you can now put in your number"".

                I have been using Rebtel since 2010 when I first visited the USA.  I was in Boston Massachusetts for one year 2010 to 2011. Rebtel offered me a very convenient opportunity to communicate with family in Nigeria and elsewhere.  The practice of converting international numbers to local numbers made life really easy. Another point is the ability to recharge without breaking your discussion.  I have since recommended it for my wife.  In 2014 when my wife and I were in Texas we used Rebtel for the 5 months period of our stay.  Noe my wife is back to Massachusetts I made sure she continued with Rebtel.  i was pleasantly surprised that I can now use it in Congo and I have since registered and I am using it to call Nigeria.  Rebtel is convenient and affordable

                With the new app lost the ability to copy paste a whole number. The pre-set country dial code is irritating and requires too many clicks to change country destination calls whereas before I could just copy and paste a whole number including country code. Now with the preset country access if I paste it creates duplication of the first digits and requires more clicks to change to a different country. User interface was simpler to operate earlier I see no benefits in the new app. Customer service impossible to contact I had to go to discussion forum to find the email address and then took days to get a response that didn't answer my question, follow up was just ignored. New app not compatible with older versions of iOS. I'm a very early adopter of Rebtel but these changes makes me look at alternatives to be honest.

                Your idea is great to get people on rebelsoth the new plan  but the only thing I find deceptive is that the recipient receives the call using data. Your unique proposition is that the call connects using a local number instead of data. But if the recipient can only receive the call with  data then your unique feature falls flat if their data connection is poor.

                1. Voice quality is poor, probably less than 2khz (worst than pstn), to the extent that occasionaly i end up redialing directly to be able to understand.<br>2. Masked destination ringing. When dialing a number, you do not hear destination ringing, you hear some rebtel ring until  the other end picks up the phone. That means you do not know if the phone is closed, or rang. I am interested to have normal phone call where i hear whatever i hear when calling from normal phone.<br>3. clunky application. No easy way to use access numbers.<br>4. now no sms.<br>5. a dialer is not supposed to be a nuclear reactor. Dialer is a dialer. Something that you can type a number and press dial. With options to copy paste modify the number. I dont need your assistance on finding the country code, i know what i want to call, so you should remove this stupid list of countries. One you have an app that works, and no one is complaining, just stick with it. I do not understand why you feel obliged and urged to invent the weel every now and then. It is a dialer - not a supersonic aircraft.<br><br><br>Avoid this app.

                I have been trying for weeks now to resolve an issue with Rebtel through emails. Normally what gets back to me are automatic generated responses, or responses in poor English with little resolution to the issues that I am having with my Rebtel account. If you are having any kind of issue with Rebtel, don't expect a prompt response or that you will be able to really talk with anyone about your issues. There is no customer service telephone number, and all of the responses about your issues will be slow. 4-5 days usually. I have had no other experience with Rebtel to make the think that it is different for anyone else. The most inconvenient part is that if you use Rebtel to make calls to Cuba like I do, that you can't talk with your friends or family until the issues are resolved because Rebtel unfortunatley is one of the few applications that will actually allow you to make calls to Cuba.That is the only reason I have tolerated their horrible and impersonal customer service.

There are so many ways to make free calls that are better than Rebtel so I  mostly use it to make international texts. I just like the privacy of texts as opposed to anyone with your number being able to message you on a system like whatsapp. I added 10 dollars so i could text just realized I wasted my money. i am deleting the Rebtel app once I use up the 10 dollars and I have many friends planning to delete as well.

                I first started using Rebtel several years ago and it was a decent service. Now and again I had echo on the line but in general, not too bad. But then, oh my... why, oh why, oh why?!! The new branding with it's poorly designed interface is a total and utter disaster! First time I logged in I couldn't dial any of my local numbers because they weren't ready yet! What? So they change their logo and interface and roll it out although it won't work! Joke. I can't edit numbers, I can't add any numbers, if I delete numbers it won't allow me connect a new one.<br><br>I've been in contact with Rebtel via email for the past 3 or 4 days and the issues are still not sorted. I've had brief 'brush-off' replies from Maribel, Zahid, Alexandra and Vilhelm, just stalling and not understanding the issue. Very poor. Like many on here, I also believe that unless they change it back immediately, we'll all be gone.<br><br>And Wanda, no I was not given a ticket number as I contacted you via your website and since then via email.

                I am stunned with what Rebtel has done to itself. Everything has just gone wrong. Whoever decided on the upside down logo must have seen tis coming because everything about Rebtel is upside down. Now I am searching for an alternative after being a loyal customer for years. Can't add a new number until I delete an old one and when I select one to delete, it gives me my 50 or so numbers to choose from without a name next to it...like I am supposed to remember everyone's number. I then went back into the local numbers directory to see whose number I could delete to free up space only to find out the numbers have been wrongly allocated. Now Paul's number is showing up under Steve's name and Steve's number is now someone else's. My goodness, you couldn't make up the upside down LOGO. Perfect for the new crap called Rebtel.<br><br>I then try to delete one of my old phone numbers assigned to the Rebtel account. Shows me 3 numbers. I try to delete phone number 3 and see that 2 was deleted. I then selected to delete phone 2 and saw it ask for confirmation if I wanted to delete phone 3. Oh Lord!!!<br><br>I have also read a lot of reviews and it is just so annoying when they reply asking you to send them a private message on facebook. C'mon!! Get a regular email. Why assume everyone must have a facebook profil? I have been off facebook for 5 years so I guess there is no way for me to contact Rebtel. The image I have of Rebtel is that of a small company that's finally been exposed. You should never have changed the look and feel of the site. Ruined it all.

                I happily used the rebtel service for many years. But, it is now un-usable. It seems that the ""local numbers"" I had for international calls are gone. It tries to load forever, and nothing appears. Several emails for support bring no useful response except two that said the problem was fixed. This is a blatant lie. They should have learned that if it ain't broke don't fix it. Well, they ""fixed"" it so bad that it's broken. Disgusted!<br><br><br>att: Wanda. As you requested, #829753 is one of my support tickets to Rebtel support. Hopefully you will actually fix the problem instead of having support people tell me 2 days later that the issue is fixed or working when it is not. After logging-in, my ""local numbers"" do not load-- even with the latest chrome browser-- and adding new local numbers are not possible either.

                In my opinion, Rebtel is an excellent example, how a great idea and innovation becomes a true disaster. I was probably one of the first international users of Rebtel and registered my numbers in 3 different countries. I found it fantastic and recommended it to many of my friends. <br><br>As a result I received several credits and enjoyed sort of free calling for a while - until, suddenly, the credits got an expiration date! It's like taking an award away, but also taking my motivation away to recommend it to more friends. <br><br>And while I don't really care, when Rebtel changes it's lovable logo to an aggressive red and upside down logo for no reason, I do care, when one of the most practical services - to use SMS - is taken away. This is not only absolutely ridiculous, but also unacceptable to change the rules for a service, that people might have signed up for, just to use the option of sending SMS, because it is (besides email) the best way to communicate with people in very different time zones.<br><br>Some more bad news: When I tried to change some of my current ""local numbers"", they were DELETED, which also meant in some cases, that I lost these numbers completely. But when I tried to add those again, that I still had in my contacts with corrected info, the system tells me, that I ran out of local numbers and cannot add any additional ones.<br><br>And don't you wonder, why there is not even a link on their webpages to contact any customer service? In the beginnings of Rebtel I was even in touch with one of their founders, Jonas Lindroth, now everybody is hiding in anonymity. I guess, their is a reason for that ...<br><br>Maybe someone answers at least here to the following question: As I will not use Rebtel anymore, as soon as I cannot send SMS, how do I get my money back, that is currently on my 3 accounts (US, Europe, SouthEast-Asia)?<br><br>P.S. I totally agree with all the other reviewers here, specifically with Raul Perez. The ""new"" Rebtel is a total disaster.

                We communicated via SMS with our family in Ethiopia using Rebtel for the past two years.  It was fantastic!  It allowed up to message without concern about time difference. Messaged got through even though they live in a remote area and have intermittent phone service.  We raved about Rebtel and told everyone we knew who had people abroad about how great it was.  Then, abruptly, Rebtel 'upgrades' and our communication is cut.  No SMS messaging.  Nothing works, not on iPhone, not on website.  It is so, so, so, disappointing.  <br>Please re-install the old Rebtel while you figure out whether you really want to upgrade.  If there will be no SMS texting, please be goog about refunding our money.

The main reason why I was with you guys was because you guys had the option to call somebody free by returning the call, now you are like any other company and even worst because your app is full of inconsistencies, bugs and it lacks of options, so it really doens't make any sense for me to keep using your services. <br><br>Just in case you guys read this review the main things I can complain about is:<br><br>1st and the most annoying, there's no place anywhere in the website or app where to contact customer service, my wife has a problem connecting and it just says ""something went wrong (what? who knows!) Please try again later or contact us (where?) if the problem persists"".<br><br>2nd You guys are claiming that we can call for free to other people using the app without using wifi or internet but when I turn off wifi or mobile internet and I try to make a call to another person that has the app it says ""no internet connection to make this call"", so you are basically liars here.<br><br>3rd. I sent a complain about the problems that I'm experiencing to the old support email that I have from you guys (I'm lucky I could find it in my old emails) and I just got an email saying that you guys received the complaint and I will be contacted as soon as possible, but 5 days have passed and I haven't had any luck by getting a response ticket number (#821300) in case you are interested. <br><br>4th. Your app is horrible now and your new look is horrible as well.<br><br>and a list of the other complains so far: <br>Where can I find the free call phone for each of my contacts?<br>How can I know if the call I made or I received was a free call or a normal call?<br>How can I see in the list of calls if it was an incoming call or outgoing one?<br>I can't save my preferences after I click the button save, it says that my preferences were saved but I see the same options I had before. <br>How can I change the number of a contact, it only let me change the name now?<br><br>I'm thinking in going with other company as soon as I run out of credits seriously if you guys don't go back to the previous version you guys had before. <br>It seems like Rebtel has a new owner or whatever but the new owner just doesn't know how to run the business. I mean you guys had millions of users and I bet each day you will lose more and more if you don't change that ""new version"".

                I had to re-download the new app and it doesn't recognize my phone number, which is a valid number. I've gone on to their website, which looks very basic and when I tried to contact support, it tells me to log in. The login button doesn't go anywhere. Very annoyed! And I have credit that I can't use!

                The recent changes have removed the Nigeria big saver and max saver deals I use. (And I'm a FREQUENT caller with rebtel, using at least 3 deals each month). Also, you'd think they'd replace the deals with something better but no, Nigeria is not even on the Country Unlimited list.<br>I guess I now have to shop for another international calling app. Makes me sad cos I really loved rebtel and had always recommended it to friends. Not any more.

                I have been a rebtel user since 2010 and have enjoyed excellent world class service. Few days ago I attempted to log in and make some international calls and was surprised on not just the look and feel of the new website but also the functionality. <br>I don't know if you guys have a Quality Assurance department or what they do there but the old website was professional, easy to use and navigate, the new one is a joke.!!!! From the look I could tell this would be a disaster. I couldn't log in easily, the password was overlapping with the text in the password field, I couldn't view my contacts as they are still working on the contacts directory (joke), I could still make calls though as I had a balance, but certainly once I exhaust the funds, I don't have I'll still want to top up unless the mess is sorted out. <br>You guys have an app on Apple store and Google play, fyi not everyone uses an I phone or an android device, I'm just hugely disappointed and hope who ever just took over the realms of office reads this. You set such high standards and now this??? I'm looking into shopping around from this point. Good Luck. Ade

                I have been using the old version of Rebtel for more than a year, was quite happy with it. However, Rebtel automatically update my software to the new release, then nothing works now! The new version is very buggy, I can't make phone calls anymore, connecting to the rebtel server is so slow, I can't even change my settings through the tool, all my previous call history are gone.... Please verify and test your software thoroughly before forcing us to upgrade to the new release!!

                Beware of Rebtel, they are forcing purchases on people by setting up your account for monthly subscription purchase even though you did not subscribe. Reset your account ASAP and remove your credit cards from your account so that they have no card to charge illegal purchase. When you complain, they do not return your money.

                two of us had been a customer with them for more than two years calling to Ethiopia. We signed  up for Rebtel service with 19 cents per minute deal what they advertised on their website. This month, after two years of money lost, we discovered that Rebtel were charging us 29 cents per minute. you see how stupid people are their steeling your money. we never checked the rate each time they charged us, what we did was; just keep adding funds and calling to Ethiopia. <br><br>When I contacted them to learn how that happened, they promised me not to happen again that never fixed. our action were cut off their service.

                I downloaded the app and used it, however, I wanted to upload payment into my account and since my credit card was already registered, they took payment from my account 8 times. All I wanted was a one payment of ¬£8.60, but ¬£60.00 was eventually taken out. This is fraudulent, if you're going to use them don't register your credit card details with them. I requested for a refund for being overcharged, instead I got receipts. FRAUDS!

                I had been using Rebtel for 5 years.  Their prices are ok, not the best.  For a period early on on calls to Ukraine from USA the call quality was poor and I was disconnected several times.  I emailed customer service and they switched satellites or something and the call quality got better.  Rebtel did NOT offer any credit or free call time as a concession for the poor service and disconnected calls.  Other international phone companies always did SOMETHING to make it up to me in the past.<br><br>Service was ok for about a year.  Still not the best prices.  Then,  calls would be disconnected in about 10 seconds when calling a land line in Ukraine.  Mobile phones were ok.  I tried contacting Rebtel...... their customer service link on their Website did not work.  I cancelled the Rebtel auto-refill immediately and found a better carrier.<br><br>I left the above review and Rebtel's reply was to answer on Facebook.  I don't use Facebook.

                It is very easy to use and has good service. Cons: when you call the person and get the answering machine, you are charged without leaving a voicemail.

                While your customer service and call quality are good, the rates and extra (hidden) fees are in desperate need of adjustment. There's room for improvement, just remember that the business and services you offer are to keep family and loved ones connected, hence promoting love/closeness (should not have to make one choose which meal to skip as to afford a phone call to hear that familiar voice of your mother or husband 90 miles away)

                They advertise like unlimited calls to india for $10 , but after making calls to few numbers in india, im getting message like i have exceeded the unique number limit. I have never seen this condition anywhere in their advertisement. Also, worst part is, even im not able to call with my original balance in rebtel account. Really frustrated with rebtel service.

                I got an email for 100 free minutes call to Nigeria. I tried clicking on the 'claim offer' tab but nothing happened. So I went ahead to make a payment on the website thinking that the 100 minutes will be added. That was not the case. I also sent an email to info@info... stating the error. Rebtel, can you rectify this by adding the free minutes to my account? <br>Thanks,<br>Ola

                1) Lately when I ask for a local number for a new contact, Rebtel gives me a number of someone who is already on my contact list. For example when I asked for local numbers for Chibuzo Anyanwu Rebtel gave him Baby Okwandu's number, for Okoro Mason Rebtel gave Chinenye Okoro's number, for Emeka I. Onyeso Rebtel gave him Longinus local number. Does Rebtel have a limited number of local numbers that it can give after which it starts duplicating numbers?<br>2) Rebtel's customer service number for my area 804 592 6932 does not have an option to speak to a human being. The main menu does not have the options for all the frequently asked questions. <br>3) The connections are good most of the time and the cost is fare.

I have my mom number as Local number so I use to call her a lot. But from last week I was not able to call her stating ""You have crossed the monthly unique number you can call""<br>I tried to reach customer (Worst thing they can be contacted only by email). My questions like <br>1. When my monthly billing cycle starts and ends? - No response for this question after 4 emails<br>2. What is the Unique limit for calling? No response for this question after 4 emails<br>3. Why it is not quoted in anywhere? No response for this as well.<br><br>Only Response I got twice<br>""You have exceeded the limit of unique phone numbers you can call this month. Please note that Rebtel's unlimited calling plans are meant for private, non-commercial purposes only. You may still call the numbers you have called up until now.""<br><br>Worst and frustrating response.

                First - They might already have an account for you even though you never created one! (So me and my friend never got the intro bonus even though she referred me to Rebtel and never heard of it before)<br><br>Second - Cannot pay for your account anymore if you used ""multiple"" cards for payments! Can you believe this? So, every time we will need to remember the card that was used for last payment!!<br><br>Third - They accuse me of creating ""Multiple Accounts"" since I recharged mine and husband's Rebtel account with my credit card!<br>Duh, don't we have single account for one phone number? How does it matter if my card is used to pay for my family!!<br>Now, I cannot buy any plans unless I have a PayPal account!<br><br>This service is definitely a headache and more useless since they have too many problems, but no customer support number to talk to solve those! Just email them and no guarantee that anyone will reply..

                Been using this app for over six months . once you have an  account use on mobile or tablet platfom. Use with local calls to connect or via WiFi when on the move. When a technical issue the customer service always respond with a positive outcome. The ring tone is meaningless as does not indicate whether the receipient phone is busy offline ringing. etc. Quality of the calls is excellent. The best and cheapest app for phoning Cuba. Call counter timer only works with the WiFi mode so can be challenging knowing the exact duration of the call. Easy to top up and excellent account management with all itemised billing available

                I talk to overseas people, mostly in Africa, for almost 2,000 minutes a month. I used 'phone cards until I realised their published rates only applied for the first 4 minutes of each call--then rates sky-rocket! It is very sneaky, this detail is in the small print. You may think you are paying, say, 9p/minute but you are likely to be paying 20-30p/minute.<br><br>So I was delighted to find Rebtel, which did not engage in this underhand practice. With no card number to enter, Rebtel was easier to use and the ability to allocate a UK number to frequently called overseas numbers was brilliant. With Rebtel calling abroad whilst driving became easy.<br><br>After a few months of being very happy with Rebtel (call quality is generally better than calling cards too), I noticed the cost of calls to Zambia had suddenly tripled! No notification, nothing. Needless to say, I no longer use Rebtel.<br><br>Rebtel is a very good service but check the rates charged and keep checking--don't get caught out as I did.

                With rebtel you do not need to cut your calls to recharge because of the option to auto-recharge. This is good for business. Connections are prompt and clear. You have rebtel individual numbers you can use  from mobile and landlines.<br><br>The only problem which is more recent is that your number turns up as unknown to receivers of your call or as a local un-recognised number. This means that you are not identified as caller and your calls can be ignored. Bad for business.

                So when I first got the app it was great. Then one day they blocked my account for calling a London landline and held my credit hostage. I was told I can not call back that number if I wanted my account unblocked. Either way they ended up unblocking my account Witch was nice to use the service again because I do truly enjoy the app. But now calling the UK is four times the price as last month. And I think I am going to go to a more stable app. Either I am block for calling landlines or over night the prices go way up.

Rebtel Call From USA to Ethiopia (terminated NOT using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation)    * Call is bad quality(might even drop)    * Phone in Ethiopia show caller Id of local Ethiopian Mobile Number as if its a local call<br>I believe this second scenario happens because call is terminated using internet so bypassing Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation and generating a local call using local Ethiopian Mobile Number to the destination number. Sometimes I even hear the exact unique 'your account is low' message (not the Rebtel message) used by  Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation as if I am calling from Ethiopian Mobile phone with low account.  The people I call in Ethiopia are confused to get a call from local Ethiopian Mobile number but talk to me (from USA).  My point is this second scenario does not happen if all Rebtel calls are terminated using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.<br>The first thing I check when I place a call using Rebtel is ask the person I call if the number they get a call from is from my USA phone or local phone number. If it is my USA number, then great. If not and the caller Id is the local Ethiopian number, I am redialing again, because its bad quality and no use to continue with that call.<br> I am clear that Rebtel uses different provider to route call. That is not the issue. The issue here is, which ever provider you choose should terminate calls using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.<br>You have been giving me general answers and not addressing the issue (Scenario 2). Rebtel Calls are being terminated illegally in Ethiopia. <br>But I am glad you recognize ""Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation"" is the only legal telecom provider in Ethiopia. Second Step is to weed out the providers that don't terminate calls using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.<br>Thank you

                Hi,<br>   I was a long user for rebtel from last 4 months and the service has been exceptional but on December 8 2015 Rebtel sent me a free credit of $15 and changed my subscription on India Unlimited calling to normal plan and I still dont know the reason Every time I sent an email to their support system (supportatrebtel.com) an Empty robot responds without the related question.They still dont reply to their facebook private message which I had sent and I request to resolve my ticket number - 778385 and also also another ticket number - 777781 and convert my plan $10 to unlimited calling or refund my money back.I still dont understand what is use of their support system and also facebook just keeping fake ads. Please never buy rebtel you will have to suffer with their false promotions and false deduction of account balance.<br>   At the end of the day they would send a reply please contact supportatrebtel.com or please contact through facebook or twitter messages.

                BUNCH OF CRIMINALS. Be careful with these Luxembourg guys. They sold me a plan of 500 minutes for $19, never told me I had to use all 500 minutes within 30 days which I could NEVER do, I don't call that much. After 29 days they send me an email telling that the 500 minutes (of which i had not used a single one) was about to expire within 24 hours. In short the next day I went from 500 minutes to ZERO. You can't call them or contact them and they don't respond to emails. Had to do a charge-back, then they decide to respond by locking my account. Good luck to them!

                Lately I have been noticing some problems with rebtel services, I have been a rebtel customer for awhile now, but it's like am getting fed up with their service. They need to work more on their service. For instance, when you buy the $8 bonus cards, you still have enough minutes left, but the system will tell you, you have no more minutes, to me that's a rip off just to make you buy more.

                I did cancel my auto recharge  and yet I was charged for auto recharge. I sent out 15 emails notifying rebtel of the issue and had not heard back from them. Of course there is no phone number to reach out to them. This is not a way to run a business and it's against business ethics.

                Rebtel calls are affordable especially with their many deals. The calls are usually clear. But my favorite thing about rebtel is the app and how usable it is. I like how it seemlessly connects calls or texts even when I'm not in the app. I love how I can manage my account from the app easily and the UI is fantastic. All in all, Rebtel is great for keeping me connected to my family and friends abroad.

                I only gave one star because it requires it otherwise they don't deserve a star at all. I recently purchased 10 dollars worth of calling time I talked for less than 30 minutes and my call was already cut and keep in mind that 5 dollars usually lasts for about 35minutes. I haven't heard anything from customer service. This is by far the most ridiculous calling company I have dealt with I thought their rates were good nope!!! Not worth putting your money into it I will be going back to my other calling company was by far cheaper and more customer friendly.

                Hi all,<br>I have also faced the same issue of terminating the account saying abnormal behaviour and we are getting default answer when we contact them like saying minutes usage, unique customers and multiple device. If you find such a behavior, Rebtel should cancel the subscription by asking the evidence not by terminating the account.. Many people bought the subscription in recent days and got terminated, how come there will be abnormal usage. And Rebtel is advertising like true unlimited, why so if not able to provide maximum usage.. Also many people had the credits in their account that also gone.. When we contact them , no proper answer for 2-3 days and finally giving default answer.. If you want to provide default answer then why are u waiting to reply after 2 days, u might have sent some auto reply with default message.. Full of disappointments.. Kindly do something to solve all of our problem by modifying the terms and conditions with limited usage, not saying unlimited.. Don't try to market it with larger amount of people..provide some meaningful solution instead of sending like contact support @rebtel.com

                If my memory serve me well, I think I have been with Rebtel service for about 5 year now. the connection to your contact is seamless. no disconnection during conversation.  if the connection did not go thru at the first attempt the operator interrupts and advise to try your call another time. apart from making connection, the report of minute usage is of great importance. this report keeps me in line with my budget.  another beauty of their service is that the minute purchase carry no expiration date. the support team members are remarkable! they writes follow up message when I ran into trouble recharging with my CC.  I recommend Rebtel service to anyone whether you are new or transfer from another career to try their service at least once.  if not satisfy there is no contract or commitment that tie anyone to the company. a trial will convince you!    go rebtel, go rebtel, go rebtel!!!

                I only have one complaint. It is about responding and acting on request for credit of minutes deducted from Customers account for calls that were not properly connected or were below 20seconds duration. I complained for calls less than 15 or 10 seconds, for reimbursement of my minutes but all requests fell on deaf ears.<br><br>I gave up asking and simply continue using the service because it is cheap and of good quality

                I've used rebtel for 4-5 years now and they've met and surpassed all my expectations. My grandmother is hard of hearing and she lives in Nigeria. She is always astounded by how good the connection is, to her it feels like we're in the same room talking. The rates have gotten cheaper since I started using rebtel yet the quality is the same and even better actually. Since I switched to andriod from an iphone, I don't have to open up the rebtel app as often. I just go to my regular contacts list and dial the number like I would an American number and it seamlessly switches over to rebtel and makes the call. Amazing is all I can say!

                Personal experience:<br>their main goal is to make the most of the money...their network is mostly clear but their policies are not customer friendly. <br>Example:  If you are out of balance during conversation, they give you option to add 10 or 20 bucks immediately. But Previously they would ask to add 5, 10 r 20 bucks.They removed the option to add 5 bucks which is most popular. Just because youre in an urgent conversation and you need immediately refill, they took the chance to make you buy more which they are exploiting the users necessity for their business benefit.<br>Also, their is no customer service phone number you can find online that works. They are also very bad in refunding money even though the fault is their.

                I have been using Rebtel for long long time. They do have good quality of phone quality when you talk and the price is cheap. However, my phone broke and I got a new phone, same phone number. I forgot my login and i got new login and i lost all of my account money .. it is $0. I sent 2 emails from my phone and i just sent another email while searching using my computer and that makes me mad because I said good things about them and referred my friend to join them!  No reply? I hope I post this out they will response, if not... maybe you should be aware and think twice before you put money into Rebtel.<br><br>Finally got a response from them. here is what they said....<br>Quote:-<br>The credit on your account expires 12 months from the last account activity (SMS or call) so as long as you SMS or call at least once a year, your balance will always carry over.<br><br>This is clearly written in our Website in Legal/Terms of service<br>Unquote<br>*************************************<br>Well.. I didn't read the terms in detail but I guess I will never ever use Rebtel again.  I don't think this is a good practice. Even I didn't use for a year, still I put the money into your company.  Lucky I found out there are many phone apps now that enable you to talk on the phone overseas like ""Line"" is good to use it as phone talking. I love WeChat for text messaging, Line's phone quality is better but you can try both. The video &amp; talk not very smooth I guess depends on both connection.<br><br>Goodbye Rebtel.

                I have been Rebtel customer for long time. It is more than 3 years I have been a regular customer of Rebtel. Before last week I always had a good experience about their quality of service, both technical service and customer service. I have recommended rebtel to my family members and friends in the past.<br><br>Recently I had a bad experience.<br><br>The support was poor for the first time. I recently changed my phone number. Therefore, I requested to transfer my money from old number to new number. There was  partial money from reference bonus. Ms.  Laura was customer agent from Rebtel end. She said that bonus credit is not transferable. It was absolutely fine if that is the Rebtel policy. I did not know Rebtel policy. So, I made my request and as a customer agent her job was to explain me nicely what can be done or cannot be done based on Rebtel Policy. <br><br>However, in stead of nicely explaining me, she started to blame me that I am abusing and misusing. The terms ""abuse"" and ""misuse"" were very insulting and objectionable, especially when it was baseless and with an old customer.  It was very unprofessional behavior of Ms. Laura from Rebtel end. Then she threatened me to block my account in future.  Her whole message was rude, non-sense and unprofessional. <br><br>I expressed my dissatisfaction about her rude language in response email. She never asked apology for this rude behavior.<br><br>In the past I had opportunity to communicate with Ms. Cintia and Ms. Alexandra,who are very nice and professional but Ms. Laura was unlike them from Rebtel. <br><br>It was a bad experience.   It gave me the feelings that Rebtel does not care their customers.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Thank You so much for the reply. I feel much better to see your reply. I am not sure about the facebook page. So, i am replying here. The case number was Request #709001. Just to clarify once again, I have no complain about not transferring the bonus credit. I did not know Rebtel's policy about bonus credit. <br><br> I HAVE complain because she behaved rude with me by using terms ""abuse"", ""misuse"" and by saying ""she would block my account in future.""  That was an unacceptable treatment to a customer of more than 3 years old and who regularly use Rebtel by paying money every month.  The complain is about her behavior.<br><br>Thank You once again.... :)

                I have been using Rebtel for almost a year, and never knew until the past 3 months that they were not supposed to charge me for calls that are under 30 seconds long. So when I asked Rebtel to review my account for the past year, and refund my money for all the calls under 30 seconds, they replied back saying they only go back 30 days for refunds. So now when I ask for a refund for these charges it always take up to two weeks to get my refund, and usually they don't refund all the money they owe me. Also, I have been having a lot of trouble getting my SMS text sent to my family. either they fail delivery, or it takes 2-3 days before they are sent.

I have been using this since last one month. On my mobile number i have free landline and mobile calls to any number in gerrmany. Rebtel gave a special number on which they charged me on every number that i called. I got a bill today of 136 euros for calling to india for which i used the plan from Rebtel. I have written them an email but no response. This is disgusting and ridiculous. I have never been charged from any international calling service that i have been using since years.

                Just the job ....<br>I have been using Rebtel's services for over 6 years and since I 'discovered' this gem of a beauty, I have not found anything else to match or compare with it. The cost is almost unbelievable and I have not had any issues with call connections - something I struggled with when using other providers prior to signing up on Rebtel.<br>If I am asked to sum Rebtel up in one sentence, it'll be 'Making communication work'

Try to be consistent with your deal. This is a very poor tactics to suck people in. Count me and my friends out of your $8 and $19 deal.

                I like Rebtel. The service is mostly okay to good. Sometimes the call quality drops which should be looked into. Also regarding Rebtel website, every time I try to buy a deal, I have to click to find all the available deals and then choose my intended country from the list which is very inconvenient and does not make sense. I am not going to call in every countries on the earth, and I think same goes for majority of the people. Instead my frequently purchased deal should be listed on my homepage so that I can quickly pick that when my deal runs out.

Easy searching contacts and connect them. I would suggest only one thing that if the person in India is busy Ina call or the phone is switched off Rebtel will not give that information because we still hear ringing even the receiver is switched off. Hope inclusion of this service users will feel more better.

                Call quality is good once connected , but i have few bad experiences<br>Cons:<br>- you get ring tone even if the other side phone is not available or engaged. usually you should get beep sound so you know the other side phone is not available, you don't try again.<br>- if your balance is around 200 mins it won't allow two registered phones to make calls at the same time. It says "" there is another call going on..."" . I understand this as enforced to make sure running call has enough mins to finish. but 200+ is too high threshold it should be reduced to 30 mins or so.<br><br>Pros:<br>Good thing is it works on wifi, so you don't have to worry about poor signal or phone minutes.<br>-Comparatively cheaper for that quality<br>- You don't feel the lag in hearing the conversation

                To start with I am with rebtel for a couple of months. Everything was hunky dory. They introduced ""Unlimited calling"" worth for 30 days to call India. It worked for a day. After that, I get a message ""Your account balance is too low. Please add more credit.""<br><br>day 1) Raised a support ticket<br>day 2) Support came back asking me to give an example.<br>day 3) I gave them all the details that rebtel wanted.<br>day 4) No response<br>day 5) Asked for a response again.<br>day 5) Rebtel support responded (within 48 hours). Created a local number for the example I mentioned an day 3. Wait a minute, I gave a example as support asked. Nothing is working. Not the example alone. Icing on the top was, the local number they gave, did not work again. Same message, credit more money. They also told me that as a policy they will respond within 48 hours.<br>on Day (5), I Responded to rebtel that their ""Local access number"" itself is not working. That is what I meant in day (1) report.<br>day 6 and 7) No response. Where is their 48 hours policy to respond to customers?<br>It has been well past 48 hours since i responded to rebtel support.<br><br>I think this company rolls out products without testing. If the stuff works for you, good. If it does not, your are by yourself and you are in for a wild ride. Their support is extremely unhelpful. They try to pass the ball without taking accountability. I have easily spent many hours worth of effort fighting with something that should just work. Their support is miserable. <br><br>Please let me know if there are choices that I can do. (a) I could call credit card company to refund the payment. (b) I can create awareness of this company to my friends.<br><br>Note: I am ready corroborate the entire incident via email chain.<br><br>Update 1:<br>It has been two more days.

How can this happen?  And then when I tried to contact someone who can explain it to me , I found out that they don't have a customer support # !!!! Wow...Getting worse. . The only option is to email them &amp; wait till they email you back at their own MERCY !!?

                I have been using Rebtel for a long time. Lately I have been having problems. I bought the Nigeria big saver plan. Even though I may have credit on the saver plan I cannot make calls.  When I try to make call, the message I get is that I have no more credit. The last time this happened I bought additional credit but Still, I could not make a call.  This is very frustrating. The customer service is horrible, the worst of any company I have ever dealt with.  First of all there is no customer service telephone number where you can speak to an actual person. The only option is to leave a message.  When you get a response, it is to tell you that they will respond within 48 hours.  I should therefore wait until 48 hours to make a telephone call that could very well be an emergency?. I WILL GIVE THEM ZERO STARS.  They do not even deserve one star. How can a telephone company not have a telephone number for their customers to call.  I will never recommend Rebtel to any one. I will never use their service again until there is a customer service that actually works like a good company's.  THIS IS CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ITS WORST.<br><br>Re: Response from Rebtel<br>I am not satisfied with your response. Why don't you have a customer service number that your customer can call for help?. A company that cares for its customer will be more sensitive to their concerns. You only confirmed what I said in my review that as a customer I cannot speak directly to a customer support staff who can help resolve a problem immediately. The only way to reach your customer support staff is through Email and the response can take up to 48 hours.  I still stand by my review.<br><br>Re: Rebtel Reply<br>What is your customer service telephone number.  Why didn't someone call me directly to discuss thiis.

                When I was travelling, I downloaded and used the Rebtel App while I was in Thailand, calling to Australia for work related issues. I was quite pleased with the app, because I used my bank account to put money on it, it worked fine and it seemed very cheap. However, when I got home I found out I had paid over 130 Euros for 50 minutes of calling with the Rebtel app. How is this POSSIBLE?? I didnt see any warning, or notification that you are actually paying much more than it seems. I truly hope I can get my money back, which is why I am currently trying to reach out to the Rebtel company.

                I have been using rebtel for many years to call Nigeria. The quality is good and reliable, but of recent I got an email from them that states that the price of calling Nigeria have increase, and the increase is due to the increase on Nigeria calls by telephone companies in Nigeria after the election. But I inquired from friends and families no one could confirm the so call increase in Nigeria calls. So I'm not sure if the reduced minutes from 270 mins to 140 mins for big saver have anything to do with the election.<br>Therefore, if the rebtel have other information about the increase on incoming calls to Nigeria after the election I would like to know because I can't get anyone else to confirm the increase

                I‚Äôm using rebtel for more than 9 months and did not face any issues until 3 weeks before when they deducted  $14.9 &amp; $5 from my credit card without any reason.  When I contacted their support desk they mentioned that it was deducted due to some technical problems with their payment system and the money will be refunded as the issue is fixed. After a week time, I got the $5 refund but till now I did not get $14.9. I sent many follow-up emails on this to their support desk. it has been almost 3 weeks over now but still struggling to get my money which was deducted due to their own system failure.

                When it's good its good.  I often have to call numbers 4-5 times for it to go through and when it goes through I have to rush my conversations due to the high volume of dropped calls , and then I have to repeat the process of calling back 4-5 times(i call direct to make sure the call will be answered by the person I am calling and 100% of the time the person picks up) so it is the app that is 50/50. I have been a customer for 2yrs it is time to find something more reliable <br>-Marcus

                i joined Rebtel by buying 293 minutes for $10 for calls to Kenya from USA through a promotion but never received the minutes. Instead for $10, I received less than 60 minutes (including rounding) for a total of 7 calls. The rate to Kenya is advertised as 6.9 c/minute but was being charged 16 c/min. This is a complete rip-off and false advertising. On the plus side, Rebtel App is awesome.

After making my first phone calls I received my bill from my mobile phone Provider (Orange) and had to pay ‚Ç¨ 17 extra for just 4 calls.<br>Although the calls were transfered through a local number in Madrid I had to pay double for using Rebtel. After informing the helpdesk of Rebtel twice  I did not get any answer. Rebtel  seems to be a clear cheat  to me.<br>regards <br>Hans van Maanen<br><br>After 3 times sending an e-mail to Rebtel help desk I am still waiting for a proper answer on my questions !!<br><br>This the 4th reaction of Rebtel in which they do not answer the questuion.

                What I enjoy the most about rebtel is the call quality, way superior than other competitors. However one thing that I don't like is when you have 60 seconds left on the call, the 60s warning recording is way too long, that lady speak forever, and while she is speaking the caller can't hear anything, I think that could be changed to a short beep or something simpler, now the 60s warning recording is longer than a few months ago when it was already way to long.

                I honestly think that rebtel is a great company, for making communication easily accessible world wide., however I think that rebtel should have african office especially Nigeria to facilitate and encourage more nigerian to subscribe.

                I am a Rebtel client for years now. I call mostly in Cameroon. The price is too high and the minutes paid for are always lower what they should be. There is no discount nor any special deal for regular costumers. Instead of asking to people to sign up for a $20+, Rebtel should bring their price lower for people paying that much within the proposed timeframe.

Inspite high balance account in my Rebtel account and on my 2 registered phone numbers..i keep hearing ""your credit is too low"", turned off my ipad, i also uninstalled the App but still the same..I am going to cancel my account when my call credit on my app store account or on my credit card is back.

                Rebtel unfortunately has the worst customer service system and personnel. I have been a loyal customer of Rebtel for a long time but sadly, on several occasions that I had billing problems with my account, The customer service turns the other way. I am constantly treated like an unwelcome customer. Obviously, my business is not valued neither does my experience matter. <br>On the other hand, what's the point of being a telecommunication company if customers cannot reach your team on the phone?

Now without a functioning app, I have to login to the web portal for each new person I want to call, create a local number and then call them.  What an annoyance!

                I have been using Rebtel for making calls to a few countries for last few years and quite satisfied with the cost and quality of calls and services. There are other companies in the market and their cost are competitive and services are good either. So, Rebtel may continuously thrive for being the market leader.

                At times when marking international calls, it does not connect properly. Is either I can't hear the person on the other side or they can't hear me. At the same time my credit is been deducted.

                Rebtel has very good service. recently they make it little expensive. 1000 minutes per month deal was less ten $19 dollars. Now it is  more than $23 dollars.<br>Defiantly need to improve the Fake Dial tone or ring tone. If I make a call it is keep ringing with a fake ring tone, until other side pick up the phone. I also use other phone service where I get real ring tone. with that I know how many time it was ring, If the phone is off, or out of network, or busy. Also if the receiver set a ring tone for me I can hear that too. But with Rebtel you are blind - until the other side pick up the phone and talk to you.<br>Another thing is that, If you have a deal plan Rebtel does not tell you how many minutes do you have? or how many minutes left while you are calling.<br><br>Most of my friends use Rebtel. People like me use Rebel to talk to their loved ones, who lived in overseas. Once they are here they stop the service because Rebtel becomes expensive on a monthly basis when you use with home phone or even with your cell phone for occasional use.

                Use this company only if you don't mind your money stolen. I placed $50 on my account and used only about $10 of it. Several months later, my account balance was $0. They pocketed my money and will not refund the money back to me. Just beware when trusting your money to them. <br>Also, not all calls go through and at times the connection is really poor. Another thing is that it takes them between 24-72 hours to post the money on your account so if you need to make an urgent call, you have to wait until the money is posted to the account to do so.

                This app has helped save a very long distance relationship!!can't always connect calls but in fairness that's more to do with local telecoms in africa.Call quality when connected is very clear. After carefully checking my bill charges do 'exactly as it says on the tin'...shame mobile networks can't compete with services such as this one and insist on fleecing so much extra money on top of contracts....thankyou rebtel :))

                I am really happy to use my android and my internet connection with Rebtel. Recently they have developed another product named Sendly through which I can now top up my family's mobile from anywhere. And when I have good internet connection, the conversation is very fluent. But I hope rebtel will develop their application to fix the problem with one hour talking limit. Also the rate of calling is a bit high comparison to other providers. They should lower the rate. Even though I will suggest anyone to use Rebtel.

                I've just signed up for Rebtel.  When I looked at the rates on line, they said it was 4.9cents a minute to call France.  I down loaded the app, and used my credit card to buy $4.90 or 100 minutes as stated on the website, but when I asked for a rate through the app, it said 17 cents per minute.  That is significantly higher and not acceptable!  I entered my credit card information twice, and it is still not showing my purchase of $4.90 (or possibly $9.80).  Rebtel, please show you are reputable and help me through this.  Thanks!

                The worst issue is that some numbers (not all) they allocate are listed as LOCAL NUMBERS but when you dial them then on the next bill from your phone provider you find that they were NOT local numbers and you have to pay TWICE for the same call: normal rates to your provider and Rebtel rates to Rebtel. So much about ""special low rates"".<br><br>And they charge in $US or Euro. You CAN NOT select $AUD, which means every time you re charge you pay via 'bad' exchange rate (I checked this) and on top of that you might be charged 'international processing fee' (which is my case was approx $1 for every $10 purchased). <br><br>Sometimes call quality is so bad that I just had to hang up and try again the next day.<br><br>I strongly NOT recommend Rebtel - try some other ones - when my credit is used up I will switch to another one.

                A long-time, one-time RebTel fan, I recently became aware of how RebTel offers such low rates: 1) your minutes start when the call/ringing begins ‚Äî not upon an actual connection, 2) it *simply* rings regardless of what is happening in the destination country (busy, error message, etc), and 3) I've even heard that after ringing constantly for over a minute (if left ringing it tries twice during a single call), the receiving party only got the last few rings(!). This is a real problem and questionable technique‚Ä¶ dare I say ""scam."" <br><br>I'm already paying a local rate every time a call is initiated without connection using a local number during this erroneous ringing period ‚Äî why should we also pay an international FOR NO CONNECTION? <br><br>Curious how many of you have been experiencing this, but did not know.

                I am an living in the US, using Rebtel for more than 2 years.<br><br>I got an email from Rebtel yesterday, congratulating the Islamic Eid after Ramadan!<br>I was really shocked to see that Rebtel has categorized me as a Muslim and is spying on my contacts! This is a very big marketing mistake for them! Rebtel is a telecom. company, and should not in any way involves the religious belief of customers in their marketing strategy. Rebtel SHOULD NOT spy on my contact lists! I am looking to replace Rebtel with something else due to these facts:<br>- Bridge of my privacy and categorizing me as a 6-cylinder Muslim while I have no religious affiliation.<br>- The quality is very very BAD for the first time connections. You have to re-call to get a better quality. In this way, they can charge more minutes! <br>- I am not sure if they sell consumers data to NSA etc etc! What if I go under the surveillance of NSA etc etc because you Rebtel guys put me in practicing Muslim lists. <br>If Rebtel does not provide any satisfactory explanation for me, I will definitely go after them both legally and on the net. I warn everyone about these serious issues.<br><br><br>------<br>This is my response to Rebtel team's response:<br>------------------ <br>Dear Rebtel Team,<br><br>Religion is a very sensitive issue! PLEASE DO NOT use it for marketing purposes! <br><br>You should be aware that in those countries, there are a large group of minorities who are suffering from religious related discrimination and violations!<br><br>Let me give you an example to make the case clear if it is hard for you to understand my point: <br><br>- Your job is to connect people in the best way! Not to congratulate the birth day of Muhammed, Moses or Jesus, based on the stereotypes! What about sending an email to Neo-Nazis congratulating Hitler's birthday, and having some Holocaust survivors in the that mailing list, too! Are you guys sending a Merry Christmas message to Christian minorities in these Islamic countries. Of course not!<br><br>In short, you guys should not be identifying your diverse body of customers based on their religions!!! That is like labeling people! In all of those countries you named there are tens of non-Islamic religions. <br><br>I might have called some of those countries that you named but this is my business and NOT YOUR business to track my calling list and put me in your ""Muslim Box""! What if I call India another day: <br><br>Am I a Hindu or Buddhist or Muslim or Christian or ...?!!! That is ridiculous! <br><br>This is exactly what NSA programs are doing! Checking who is calling whom and how long and then label them! And they will be very pleased to know that you guys have reduced their work load with your religion boxes with the names of costumers!! <br><br>Being at any points of the world, does not give you any immunity from NSA or other agencies! Are suggesting you guys have a better security than Google and Yahoo and Apple ;) <br><br>By the way, are 100% of people in Sweden Christian and love Jesus and go to Church!? Of course not! So, that is non-sense to get religious messages involved in the business, specially cherry-picking for Muslims.

                I was upset as I felt Rebtel had not informed me about rounding up all charges to next minute (so 50 minute package may only give say 45 minutes) and had ignored by emails and social media protests for 3 months. Last week (end July 2014) they finally improved, read my email, updated their Terms &amp; Conditions to make the charges explicit, answered my emails and gave me a credit. I am much happier if they can keep up this level of customer service and I am sure it is good for Rebtel's business too.

                So, I got sent a Facebook ad saying 149 minutes to Gambia for ¬£1.49.  As I've got a project in Gambia this was a must have offer!  So I got it and made a 22 minute phone call to Gambia.  Yay! this would have cost me ¬£11 so that was a saving already.  The following week I tried to make another call and it said I had no credit.  When I emailed Rebtel they told me that the 149 minutes had to be used within a week!  They were unable to provide me with the small print I was supposed to have read, but in any case, it was underhand and sneaky and they didn't honour the offer with which I joined.

So to say that I'm a loyal customer is an understatement. I typically buy the MaxSaver deals. <br><br>This month Rebtel randomly locked my account. I contacted them right away and they did not respond for 3 days. The MaxSaver deals only last for 14 days. Hence I was unable to use my minutes for those 3 days (roughly 22% of the time given). I have ALWAYS exhausted the minutes in my MaxSaver deals. So this month I lost 285 minutes because they shut off my account. Rebtel refused to extend the deal but instead gave me 20 minutes as ""compensation"" for my inconvenience. I have an international startup and it was disrupted because of Rebtel. AND their solution: 20 minutes. <br><br>I contacted customer service and their response was: <br>_____________<br>Thanks for contacting us!<br><br>i totally understand your request but as stated before its not possible for me to extend the period of your deal since the deal no longer shows on your account.<br><br>Every deal that expire, disappear totally from the users account.<br><br>Best Regards,<br><br>Martial<br>Customer Team<br>____________<br><br>Rebtel SHUT DOWN MY ACCOUNT for no reason so I wasn't able to use my minutes and then refused to either extend the deal for the 3 days they made the mistake, nor would they give me my minutes back.

                When I first used Rebtel (1 year ago) I found them to be excellent value and the call quality was great. However I recently went to Morocco &amp; used their service. The call quality was poor &amp; kept dropping. When I arrived home I found that Rebtel had diverted the call to my provider and I am now stuck with large call charges, made even higher because the call kept dropping. I contacted Customer services almost 10 times in over 2 weeks but they will not  respond. Avoid them at all costs or they could cost you huge amounts of money.<br><br>Their mission statement states that they want to provide 'the first genuinely good, honest, and trustworthy global mobile telecommunications service that saves people money'. They have failed on every count. My original review was challenged by Rebtel within 2 days and has been suspended for review, yet their Customer Service department has still not contacted me. Unless you want to risk a similar experience I would strongly recommend avoiding this company.

No apps seemed to work with our Blackberrys, I was using Skype on my laptop to call her but there were times that she wanted to call and she was paying close to $6 a minute, until I came upon Rebtel, it took me a while to figure out how it works, somehow it was not clear to me, but once I figured it out it was easy. Now we can make calls using our free local minutes. I'm very satisfied with Rebtel the quality of calls is very good and it is very easy to use.

                I just tried my first few phone calls to Kenya. I was pleased with the quality of the connections but especially pleased to be able to do so at such a comparatively reasonable price. The system of having a local number to call to reach friends in Kenya works surprisingly well.

                A friend of mine introduced me to rebtel few months ago and ever since I have stopped using phone cards to make international calls because rebtel is relatively cheaper and fast. You don't have to worry about the number for international call since rebtel connects you direct. It is also very reliable and connects you without fail. My desire is that rebtel network is advertised nationwide with their agencies all over the country because it seems to be very new anytime I introduce it to friends.

                Bought USA to India package, 2.4$ - 243 minutes(one month validity). Here is my feedback.<br>Pros:<br>1)Available in cheaper denomination so that you can try.<br>2)android mobile app is user friendly and you needn't dial lot of codes to connect to a call. call gets connected just as simple as a normal local call.<br>3)Login to your account to see remaining minutes, call history and call duration for every call that you made. They are accurate.<br><br>Cons:<br>1)They automatically debit your account once a new month starts. There should have been an option to disable that.

                I've been using rebtel to call my girlfriend in Cambodia for about 3 weeks now. Sure, rebtel rates are fairly cheap but is it really worth it when both of us cannot make out what the other person is saying? We're constantly asking each other to repeat themselves because it's so muffled. We usually end our conversations more frustrated than anything because it's extremely annoying to have to repeat yourself over and over again. Also, there's a feature on the mobile app for collect SMS. Meaning the other person can text you and it will charge you. At least the SMS go through well, right? Well.. yes and no. I was ecstatic to find out that I can pay for her SMS sent to me because being in the Peace Corps, she's limited financially. I turned on the feature and let her know that she can text me freely because she does not have to pay for it. But did it charge me? Nope. Did it charge her? Yes.<br><br>Rebtel has given me the worst emotional blue balls a phone service can possibly give to a person. Teasing me with the idea that I can talk to my significant other freely but turning around and slapping me in the face with horrible call quality and dysfunctional features.

                They have a promotion to call to Cuba in which they double the minutes when making a deposit, in this case I deposit for $25 and suposed to receive 50 minutes, but I was calling to Cuba and conection is harder than calling to any other place. After few attempts my call finally when thru, but I noticed the time remaning was shorter and when checking the calls time I saw they count the unsuccessful intents a part of the time within the promotion, not just that but if your firsts call fail and it last for 1:03 that counts for 2:00 minutes, because this is the way they do it according to a representative called Fernando who took care of my complaint. In resume be aware that you will not enjoy the full minutes indicated as they say.

Calls are dropped for no reason, from the Rebtel servers. I give them a 2 out of 10 across the board. I give them a 10 of 10 in regards to taking my money promptly while still not fixing services.

                I have searched a long time for a phone card or other subscription that would enable me to make cheap international calls, and at last I have found one in Rebtel. There are no frills, no gimmicks, just a fast-working method that brings me in contact with loved ones in New Zealand, the USA and elsewhere by dialing a special number. I am amazed at how cheap it is--I initially bought for ten dollars and still have almost five dollars left, after 10-12 calls each lasting more than ten minutes and some up to forty. I don't know how Rebtel does it, but I have just bought more time!

                I've been using Rebtel for over two years now and largely the service is convenient and competitive on pricing. However my issue is with custmer service, if you ever run into technical difficulties, you can not speak to anyone, you have to send off an email and wait until someone gets back to you. The access number in Toronto has been unavailable for a couple of hours now and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it but wait for Rebtel to respond to me in their own sweet time. Does not work for me! Time to look for an alternative service.

                I call India usually. Call rates are very high on Rebtel, but the deals for India are good. you have a big India saver and Max India saver, I hope you can include one more deals which is between these ranges(for may be 500 minutes per month, which is ideal).

                I was reviewing my account and found out that I had been billed $50 by Rebtel without a corresponding e mail from Rebtel. I contacted my bank and informed them that this was a fraudulent billing. When my bank contacted Rebtel their response was to shut down my account and then had the audacity to tell me that I must inform my bank to release the hold. They then proceeded to tell me that it must have been a mistake from my bank. That was rubbish. I had been using Rebtel for approximately three to five years and spend approximately $200 to $500 per month on their services. My service was temporarily restored and after they were queried by my bank, they could not justify the charge the charge was reversed. Now they have Interrupted my account and shut it down. I am going to open a face book page and urge people to BOYCOTT REBTEL. I have been instrumental in getting many of my friends turned on to Rebtel. Now I am going to have to tell them about this experience. I had hitherto suspected that Rebtel was making fraudulent charges to my account without the corresponding credits being given and this time I caught them red handed. I have also had an exerience of where my account was being advanced charged for replenishment even though I had not selected that option. REBTEL SUCKS  BIG TIME AND I INTEND TO LET THE WORLD KNOW ABOUT THIS.

                When calling Algeria mobiles with my mobile the reception isn't as high quality as it could be.

                Rebtel is apparently an over the Internet phone service. It is cheaper than most  phone card schemes, and reduces the number of digits one must dial from 30 to 10. However, the sound quality is not always as good as it should be, and calls are often just dropped for no apparent reason, followed by redialing that does not reconnect the call. T reconnect, I must hang up and redial again. All the Rebtel calls I have made have been to a cellphone in the Dominican Republic.  Sound quality is also occasionally terrible when using calling cards to the same country from the US.

                I've lived in South &amp; North America for some time; have had a chance to use Rebtel for 6 month or so. First, let me talk about their SMS service. It sucks! I'm not sure how the system selects on what phone number to assign an SMS icon, most of the time the icon does not appear next to the contact that was added, and an e-mail to the customer service has to be sent, and their reply which will take days to say ""we have received your e-mail"" and then another days to say, it has been fixed. Which I don't have time to wait for, all these in days?? Even when you sent an SMS, it gets delayed almost 90% of the time, and Rebtel always blames the 3rd world countries or the developing countries Telecommunication service, which I have hard time to believe when I can send an sms to 3 different people leaving in the same city/region and radius, only 1 will get the sms in minutes, while the others gets it in hours or even days later. Are you kidding me Rebtel???<br>The phone service is acceptable considering, occasionally a network problem which can happen with all VIP phones; however whenever I added minutes almost all the time, I won't see my added minutes or balance for another 10-20 minutes, and that is a time I can't afford to lose, since most calls are made overseas and there are time zone concerns and etc...so timing is very important to me, which I never got from Rebtel till the end. I have had a handful of dropped calls while calling different parts of the world; I was given a credit for some, which is of course after complaining. Due to all my experiences,  I did not feel comfortable leaving my CC information saved there during that 6 month I was using.<br>Now as I write this, my account has been blocked for unknown reason, it's still locked and I'm tired of going back and forth with their inconsistent customer service I was forced to abandon my account and look for other service elsewhere.

                The best part of Rebtel is the connect via Local Phone option. Sometimes, the WIFI causes issues but when you connect via Local Phone option it is smooth &amp; zero disturbance. But, Rebtel should provide some discounts to its loyal customers in terms of free credit of 5 or 10%. That would help increase the loyalty.<br><br>Sayan

                I started using rebtel around March 2013, and gave it a try because of their pricing. It worked out okay until they could not trace my funds wired from Paypal into my account. Their customer service did a horrible job by deploying delay tactics from Friday 24th 2013 and as I write this review, they are yet to credit $25.00 back into my account to reflect the funds as being available in the account. <br><br>The most annoying part is the scam like emails which they keep sending when your email them.such as ""our support is currently unavailable""or email us back in 2 days as we are adding new tools and improving our routines to offer a better Support! <br><br>All together I have sent approximately 13 emails, in which I get such responses about how their ""Engineers"" are working round the clock. My $25.00 is yet to be posted to my account. What a scam of a company!!!! By the way I will not advise anyone to use their credit card on their website..

                I've been using Rebtel for about 2 years now and I love the fact that I can have a domestic number generated and stored on my phone for me to call my parents who live overseas. In this time and age, who would remember any phone numbers anyways? <br><br>One feature I regret that Rebtel hasn't offered to me but my German colleague enjoys is that she can generate a domestic phone number for her mom in Germany to call her back on her. I hope this feature can soon be offered to other parts of the world. Thanks.

                Have been using Rebtel for quite a while now. The service is really great with competitive rates when compared with other service providers. The call quality is also good. Only concern is that - though the website says we can use it in Australia, the Australian bank does charge us for the AUD to USD conversion - which varies from the credit money that we choose.

                Why oh why do prices vary across currencies?<br>Don't you notice that some prices in USD are 3 times as much as the same prices when presented in GBP or EUR?<br>This definitely scares away consumers who pay with $, because your prices are dramatically less competitive in USD.<br><br>Also, your call prices to UK mobiles could be WAY more competitive if you renegotiate your terms with your connection provider. Mobile termination rates in the UK have gone down significantly and are now about 1-2 GBP pence per minute. But you charge more than 10 GBP pence per minute to UK mobiles. That means that your connection provider in the UK IS RIPPING YOU OFF!!!

                I have called cuba for one and half years now and paid way too much money to Bell and Rogers. My monthly bills were way too much money. Now with Rebtel it is a lot more manageable, what a great rate, not to mention the clarity is like calling next door and this is from my cellphone. Also when i call, the cuban operator does not come on and charge me for a minute. This can happen several times trying to get through. I have a good canadian buddy in cuba now, wait til i tell him this, he really likes to save money. I am really happy i found Rebtel on the internet, i will spread the word. Muchos gracious.

                I have been a Rebtel customer for over a year now, I always use it to call parents back in Tanzania. Recently they have increased the price claiming that they need to maintain their call quality and thus the increase in price! Well increase from around 10p t0 19.9p? seriously? I will never use rebtel again.. why put up with increased price when there are other competitors in the market providing the same service for less then 9p a minute.

                I use Rebtel for speaking to my kids who live abroad. You get a reliable signal and its the cheapest I've found. The website and the system of local numbers is easy to use. The only thing I don't like is the app which wants to use google to harvest all my contacts which is very annoying as I only want to call people abroad using Rebtel. Igot rid of the app on my phone and just go to the website to check the account and top up. Apart from that its great.

                Since I started using rebtel, calling my family back in Nigeria and Ghana has been easy and so so convinient. My only worry is that the rates to Ghana is so high. Last year, rebtel gave us 17 cents a minute only to take it back to 23.9 cents. If something can be done about it, Ghanaians will be very very happy just as Nigerians are now

                I have other services in the past and Rebtel is at the top. One of the best things about it is that I can call anywhere in the world, cellphone or landline without being robbed and with a very reliable connection. I would definitely recommend Rebtel to anyone.

                It's so nice to get a number in Amsterdam for each person I want to call abroad. I can use my landline for that with unlimited calls to landlines in the Netherlands. I can also use my mobile with 800 minutes for landllines and mobile lines in the Netherlands for that. I don't have to be online after I have purchased credit for my Rebtel account. The fees for several countries are great. India is cheaper than ever. I used to have ‚Ç¨0,015 as the smallest fee and several times I paid ‚Ç¨0,02 to ‚Ç¨0,03/minute. Now only ‚Ç¨0,008 and only when the line is answered. Ghana and Mali have competetive prices. They can't still be cheap as ‚Ç¨0,07 would be. But they are just below ‚Ç¨0,15 and that's quite a standard price for other cheap ways of calling those countries. Rebtel has managed to keep their prices a little below that price of ‚Ç¨0,15 which I consider a great accomplishment.<br>Uganda and Kenya and even Pakistan are relatively cheap at ‚Ç¨0,07 app. Very happy about that.<br><br>Sending an sms must be done on the website. However you can type fast as you can use a normal keyboard which isn't possible on a handy. Sms's are cheap. I would have to pay ‚Ç¨0,55 for sending an sms to India with my mobile phone provider. Now with Rebtel it costs ‚Ç¨0,02. I also get to see when the sms is delivered. Great! I can see exactly how long it took for the sms to be delivered. I can also allow the other person to call me back or sms me back at my cost. Best of all: I don't have to pay incase the other person doesn't answer the phone. Incase I would use a cheap service number (0900 numbers) in the Netherlands for which I can call India for ‚Ç¨0,02 I would still have to pay for the 1 minute and 25 seconds I was trying to reach him. That is rounded to 2 minutes so it would cost me ‚Ç¨0,04 in total. If I would do that multiples times (as I have done at times) I am still spending a lot of money.<br><br>On the downside: I can't let somebody call me back or sms me back for free incase they don't have a working internet connection on their mobile phone. They might not have a subscription for internet or their bundle might have finished or they might not have purchased internet as they might not have enough money for that. In all of these cases they can't just simply call me back at my cost. That's different with a Collect Call. An operator will ask permission and will connect the other person to me at my cost. It is expensive of course but it works. Now however people can only respond incase they can access the internet. It would have been nice if the system recognizes that I have used Rebtel for sending the sms or for calling them so that the system automatically will deduct the collect call fees for a call or sms of my Rebtel account.<br><br>Keep going!

                I was excited by Rebtel when it was first recommended to me by a friend, and I've used it several times with success. However, in a recent experience, I called someone, they didn't answer, but then they called back using the Rebtel numbers, and unknowingly I somehow ""accepted"" a collect call. Because I believed the rate to be 1.5 cents per minute, I talked for 30 minutes, only to find my account charged for close to $9. Apparently a small noise made at the beginning of my call was supposed to alert me that I was getting charged at this absurdly high rate. I think it's abusive of Rebtel to believe anyone could figure that out. I promptly went into my settings and changed my alert for receiving collect calls - I suggest all other users do the same. But I am now much more hesitant to use Rebtel due to fear of other hidden charges.

                Rebtel is the best way to make international calls (not just India). It provides different ways to make calls, over the internet/ 3G/ wifi using application on your phone or PC (windows only), calling local access number and assigning a local number to your frequently called number (useful when there is no internet or you don't have a smartphone, my preferred way). So you can make international calls even if you don't have smartphone or internet connectivity. On top of that, Rebtel provides cheapest rates. Thanks for the service.

                Guyz this is an amazing gift to all who make distant calls (I mean international calls), but also calls within one's country. Can you imagine free calls from Rebtel to Rebtel.  The calls are clear and faster and above all cheaper. Choose rebtel and experience life as never before. Having said that I wish to suggest that call charges incurred by users for unconnected calls be re-embursed, so could Rebtel please do some reviews and take some appropriate decisions (that includes my account).

When raised a request I was credited with some free minutes just before the year end and they never informed the minutes are going to lapse in minutes. This was just fooling around.

Also, when speaking for 1.03 minutes I am charged for 2 minutes, which I don't approve of  at all. That's not the case with hotcom.fi, which remains my favorite operator.

                I'm impressed with the service, and the rates charged. I wish it was cheaper to Cuba, but its still cheaper than anywhere else I have found. I have had a few dropped calls, but I believe that is because of using WiFi, as I have not had any dropped calls while using my local minutes. Over all I'm impressed.

                I have assessed your call rates and other rates obtained online, I found to my disappointment that your rates are much higher and even at that the call minutes are much shorter than what is stipulated on your calling rate, I do not understand why it is so. When I bought a $25 card It doesnt last me upto 2hours and before i could make one or two calls, the entire minutes on my card is already exhanused. Im suprised that a $25 card canm not even last me for 2hours<br>Thanks

                If you call friends and family abroad, then this is the VOIP provider to use. iPhone, Android and access via normal land-line phones.<br><br>Calls are very cheap 0.243 for where I call. That beats any other provider, also no 0844 or 0870 numbers to call, where the connection charges are 14.0p, plus poor quality service.<br><br>With this you pay a fixed rate and can call from your mobile or landline, where ever you are. Also you can assign local numbers such as 020, 0121, 0114 etc numbers, so when you call that number the call gets directed to the international number, saving you lots of money.<br><br>I'm very happy with the service and will continue to use this unless someone else comes along and offers rates around 0.01p, which I very much doubt for now.

                Lately, the rate to call Japan was raised from 2 cents to 7 cents - 3 times higher. Yet, the quality became worse. On my recent call to Japan, I was able to hear my mother on the other end, but she did not hear me at all, so she hung up - 7 cents for this. Both of us could hear each other on the 2nd call. Then my phone lost battery, so the call was terminated, and I called again. Same as the 1st call - my mother did not hear me - another 7 cents for nothing. I called back and it worked okay for a while, but my balance was getting low, so I added funds ($10) during the call. Guess what? The call was ended by Rebtel when the balance dropped to $10.03. Yes, there were beeps and notifications, and also automated operator was asking me to add funds. I already added funds online, so I did not add more funds on the phone. I switched from Google Voice due to the fact I had to close my Google accout. Rebtel calls worked better at the same rate of 2 cents a minute as Google Voice, before the rate went up to 7 cents. It does not make sense to me.

                I recently change my international calls from Union Telecard whom have been using for 5 yrs now to Rebtel. My brother mentioned Rebtel and at a chance I sign up 3months ago but dont use it frequently but then this month I was looking at account and realised I still have some money left which prompted to compute the cost per minute boy what a surprise. Rebtel was way cheaper than what I was using imagine my lost minutes for the last five years oh well am with Rebtel now.

Although I have had so far courteous service from Customer Services, this problem was logged 3 days ago and nothing has been done since.  This is deeply frustrating as I need access to a VOIP/sms service<br><br>I have uninstalled the Rebtel App from my android phone as I consider that neither Rebtel nor google nor anyone else needs to have access to my private contact list nor any other private data. I think the ubiquitous collecting of data by suc services as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and now Rebtel  should be of great cocern to everyone but most do not think about the consequences.  I do nd am not prepared to give up control of my personal data to anyone un-necessarily.  I have paid to use this service and as far as I am concerned Rebtel should only require the information needed to administer the account and payment,  <br><br>I wish to continues to use this service but I will only consider using Rebtel's web page based services.

                The technology,service and connectivity stand out as the best since I started using Rebtel. I am yet to be disappointed once, therefore I termed it a new dawn in international telephone industry.<br>However, ""the introduce a friend policy"" is yet unclear. Because in this present economic climate, every individual wants to verify the authenticity of any service provider. Therefore the friend introduced will prefer to visit that quoted website independently and may NOT necessarily use the code number assigned.<br>Can the email addresses provided be used to compesate the introducer rather than the code number.<br>Anyhow I wish you success and make every effort to maintain the standard and develop more juicy services.

                I call Ukraine frequently and it is unusual for a call to last more than a couple of minutes. I keep having to call back, talk a little, get disconnected.<br>What's worse is that I often don't get through at all. It rings and rings and no answer and I KNOW the other side is waiting for my call, it just doesn't ring on their end.

                Before i came to the USA in august 2012, i had been severally warned of how expensive it is to call back home(Kenya). I got here, a friend introduced me to rebtel. Its so cheap for me to call and text. I feel at home, speaking to my son every day for about 25dollars in a month. The best part is, they can see my number when i call and receive my calls readily. And they can call back! awesome.

                I learned about Rebtel from my sister who is in the US and I have never been this happy. I used to spend a lot on buying airtime to call my people back in Kenya but since I started using Rebtel, my telephone charges have reduced by over 500%. I need not to say more, but am a really happy customer. The service is of high quality with no cross- talk, channel interference, high voice clarity among other things. You want to get real value for your money? look no further than Rebtel.

                I have tried lots of calling cards and sites for calling USA to India before. I have found the rebtel.com is the best and cheapest site for call. One best thing I like about this site is we can dial any numbers direct by the name, in calling cards and other site we have to type long numbers to make a call. Not only that but you can call your contact number from any phone or computer. Off course the rates are awesome. I defiantly give 5 star to rebtel.com. Please try it without any fear.

                My sister lives in Norway and I live in the U.S. and keeping in touch can get expensive. Skype is awesome, but means you have to be chained to a computer to have the conversation. Then I found Rebtel. Wow. The prices are excellent and now I can pick up the phone and CALL her ANYTIME. No more logging in to the computer. WOW. It's revolutionized our relationship! It feels like old times when I could just pick up the phone and give her a ring. Thank you, Rebtel!

The other thing I like about it is that it is so clear you think you are talking to them as if they are down the street.  Love it.  Already recommended it to a lot of my friends.

                I had imagined that there could be a more simple way to phone cards instead of fumbling through more cards, and worst still having to dial the many numbers, and if you missed a digit  you will have to start all over again. With Rebtel, Bingo!!<br>However I am thinking if it could be possible to have just a pre code replacing the local number followed by the number one wishes to dial. This way, one does not even have to go through the operator. <br>Using a cell phone, you cannot dial from your contacts menu when the operator comes on. The number you wish to call has to be copied in writing from your contacts menu, then quickly upload the dialing pad to dial the number. Can there be a solution ?

                I've been using their service for Iran. I liked the fact that all the rates are flat (Tehran or other cities; cellphone or landline). It's also very convenient assigning a local number for each contact you have so that you just make one straight call instead of two step call. Five Start!

                I really recommend this, its cheap and easy to use.<br>Its easy to log in and see how much each call costs.<br>But one thing I dont like, I would like to add more credit and it says we have to get to know eachother more first. So I can only add 27 euro, and dont know when I can add more. How long do we have to know eachother first?

                I work and live in Haiti and must visit the USA for at least a month at a time.  My husband cannot yet come tot he states so I must keep in daily contact with him.  Rebtel makes this possible for us.  I can now talk to him daily!  I gave 5 stars because of the ease of the rebtel process and I have recommended this site to many.  The only thing to improve upon is to make sure when we dial the local number that it ALWAYS connects us to the correct number.  There are times it connects to a wrong number.  This happens, too, when my parents try to call me in Haiti.  Thank you!

4 stars: Great,"<p class=""review-content__text"">
                Hi,<br><br>I have not experienced any disappoint so far, the only limitation I have is that I can't call any number at will without having to pre-store  beforehand, e.g. if I have an emergency and need to quickly call a number which I have not saved before, I simply can't especially if I am not by my computer, so this makes me want to buy the calling cards where I can just dial any number without necessarily pre-storing. So please work on that, because not some of your users actually need to make other calls apart from pleasure calls to pre-registered numbers. Thanks

                I usually buy calling cards o a regular basis to  call my mother in Haiti and not only does the cast add up, but when I moved to a different town, it got harder to find calling cards with good rates.

Don't have to worry about watching the clock now, phoned her the other night, she wouldn't stop talking, got a bit worried about cost,  releived to find it only cost me ¬£1.45 for 58 minutes saving about ¬£40 over my normal BT call ,and with automatic top up i don't have to worry about being cut off. Calls go straight through and sound is excellent. Highly recommendable.

                REBTEL renders an excellent service, but the reason why I did not rate them 5-star is that, most of their rates are not cost effective. Other competitors are offering much more reasonably lower rates with the same type of services. The reason why I am still hooked to REBTEL is that, I don't want to share my credit card information with so many guys up there. At least REBTEL have been faithful to me, so I would want to continue with them rather than changing services at random. All I want to say is that, they should look at the market trend and bring to their customers services/rates that they deserve.

                Almost perfect. I'm really satisfied with the company and their program what I can use for calling from my PC. It gives great quality during calls, sms possibility. The company also gives a local phone number I could call which redirects my calls (after authentication) to that direction I set up before. Not to mention Rebtel prizes are really cheap for some direction what I use on regular basis. <br><br>I could imagine cheaper prizes for some direction (e.g.: Hungary), adding friend to contact list on PC seems not always works perfectly, missing video call option in case you want to use PC-PC call, no possibility to follow up my balance during the call (calling from PC application), what could be really annoying in case I would be close to my limit.<br><br>Rebtel website also should make some reorganisation on main page, before joining it was really hard to find calling rates, but that should be on focus every time to find it easy. It is really positive they show how many minutes you could get by $10, but would be great to see even my available balance how much minutes worth to different directions.<br><br>All in one: I recommend them, I'm happy to be their customer but would be happy to see some  more improvement from Rebtel.

                I bought this card because it is relatively cheap, however, compared with other phone cards I've ever used, rebtel has really bad connection, it usually takes me three times to finally reach someone and it often stops working in the middle of a call. I am disappointed and I want customers to know that price is not the only thing that matters. <br><br>Update, it's getting worse. I contacted the company and they said they have fixed the problem.

                While the idea is cool the implemention is clumsy adding new contacts and phoning them is time consuming. You should have something like a Skype Client using TAPI or something. The application would recognize phone numbers from emails , web etc and clicking would allow them to be added then the phoning of the contact would be ala Skype. Keep working on it it could be great.

                I presume depending on time period that the calls I made to USA, did occasionally suffer in terms of audibility. It doesn't make it impossible to communicate but there is a room to improve for sure... <br>Also the""1- 800"" alike free calls should be available to make Rebtel an all around service...  <br><br>Managing and analyzing everything from my credits to calls I made is pretty good and easy. Being able to receive collect calls is pretty flexible. And the assigned 7 digits local numbers corresponding to my international numbers makes the process very pleasant and swift. To be able to use these facilities with multiple phone numbers is very nice as well...<br>And I certainly appreciate the quality of responds that arrives eventually :)<br>Although one would say that a potentially renowned telephone company should have  A Customer phone number available to desperately help seeking customers... Even though as terrifying as it sounds! <br><br>I'm looking forward to get some complementary bonus rounds introducing your company...  Keep up the good work..<br><br>PS. I realize that my review sounds a bit promotional and I must apologize for that.. Hence your advice to be as friendly as possible but  this is what I could offer so that's what just I did... :)

                I appreciate the introductory credit with the initial $10. The Sound quality is GREAT. The software is easy to use. Overall, a great value (although I hope the price rate for Liberia will come down to as low as Nigeria's rate, &amp; better yet, as low as India's rate !!). ~ Thanks for your consideration in this regard.

                This seems to be one of the better options for making cheap international calls. It is 2 cents less than Google Voice. However the setup/registration part was more difficult than most other services. They run regular promotions, but there always seems to be a problem when I attempt to use a voucher, it is not accepted. I accidentally made a purchase and they have not refunded my money or responded.

                Rebtel was a good surprise for me. I wasn't expecting the service to work so smoothly. Sometimes the call is not that good, manly because I'm calling from a cellphone in Israel to a cellphone in Brazil, but when it happens, you just have to end the call and start again that the problem is fixed.<br>So, I really recommend Rebtel.

                Using rebtel for the first time to call India and UK from US. connectivity most of the times is very good. My only complaint is that, every time we need to call a new number in India/UK or any other country, Rebtel expects me to register that number in Rebtel website which is annoying. I may only call that number just once that time, but still had to register that online. Would be good to get a workaround for that. Thanks.

I think the connecting charge is a bit higher considering that uone has to pay vAT for recharging. Meanwhile, I'll keep on using it until we have a better offer.

                Hi there. I recently found out about rebtel and very quickly downloaded it  as an alternative to quite expansive italian rates for abroad calls. I needed sth cheap to stay in touch with my friends and family in Poland. However I found out the hard way that rebtel  fees and rates are not as clear as company want us to believe in. For example when you top up credit they charge extra tax to it. So for example a 20‚Ç¨ credit actually costs you 23‚Ç¨. But it's not all. According to the rebtel website a single minute to polish mobile phone should cost me 0,119‚Ç¨ but after a brief chat with my sister ( around 4 min) 1,5‚Ç¨ disappeared from my account. Connection itself isn't great either. So overall not sure if  Rebtel is such a great deal after all.  <br>At least not for me!

                In the relation price-quality Rebtel satifaces the price side, therefore sometimes the quality is not the best one, but it is much better than other programms.<br>The paying methods are diverse, but my only complain is that when you pay with one account (ex.

                I was introduced to the calling system by a friend a few weeks ago at work. I have just come from Africa and was trying to make a few calls but was having troble, so he showed me how the system works. Even since I have been using it I fine it to be the best. The system give you a local number for a number you are calling in Africa, that makes it easy to call. The only other concered I have is the rate. If only the rate can be lower a few  more pennies to West Africa it will help. Thanks

                Most companies offering under $1 call rates to Cuba provide horrible connections, wrong number dialing making you dial several times to get through (Onesuite), adding 1 or 2 extra minutes to all calls and charge 2 minutes for not connected calls with no reimbursement (Tel3Advantage). I found that Rebtel's call quality to Cuba is excellent and is similar to Skype. The difference is the price: Rebtel charges 89.9c per minute and Skype charges $1.249 ($1.15 + tax).<br>I wished that Rebtel offered monthly rates to call Cuba.

                This is a really good service, easy to join and easy to call.  I have family all over the world, and it is one of the cheapest ways of talking to them.  The only issue is calls to my daugther who is based in Scotland are still quite expensive (not as expensive as my local provider though :))

                Rebtel is pretty good in terms of rate and just loved the new rebtel android application. <br><br>But making calls over wifi/3g was not a smooth ride. The first call using wifi/3g would always be bad (sound cut up) but the next call is always a better one. I dont know why but that has been my experience. <br><br>And the other thing about the android app. Whenever I tried selecting a contact using the dial pad from the rebtel app, the number of the contact that I choosed never shows up, it always comesback with a UK phone number it can be very annoying. Please fix that.<br><br>And lastly please make rebtel available in bangladesh, so that we both can talk at a local rate. Thanks.

You enter the numbers international numbers you frequently use and are given a local number to dial. It's rare that there is no trickery involved. No contract, no 6 month initial deal. It's always the same rate, no surprises. Thank you Rebtel.

                Looks like a good deal so far. Someone else set up an account but he's out of the country now so I took it over. Had to start a new account since I didn't have his e-mail address but wanted to use his original phone number. Anyhow it went OK, but the first attempt to call said there was no money in the account. Maybe my fault but I checked my Credit Card account andit had been charged $20. Second attempt seems to have gone right. Much of this may have been my fault, but it is worth a little trouble to save a good bit of money, especially these days.

                Rebtel is a great alternative for international calling. My cell phone carrier charges a lot for international calls so I was looking for a cheaper solution. I like Rebtel because I can call directly from my cell phone and they also have a program for my laptop. Most of the time, the calls are clear but I have experienced choppiness and distortion more than once. All in all, I'm happy with Rebtel and can't wait for them to release a BlackBerry App for older OS versions (I have OS 5).

                Rebel is pretty good, and their rate for calling cellphones in Nigeria is very low. Also, the connection is always clear. I love the convenience of just being able to pick up the phone and dial an international number like it's a local number.  You can also make calls from phones that are not tied to the account - you'll need your primary account phone number and your pin. My only complaint is that I was charged twice for a single text message I sent, and I'm not sure if the recipient even got the message.

                This is the worst garbage i have ever used.  The boast cheap calling price, but when i got my phone plan back i was charged by my phone company for using REBTEL's ""loca"" numbers.  I ended paying rebtel and the phone company so it was more expensive.  Rebtel does not make it their point to make sure the customers have all the information before use.  After this happened i went back to the rebtel website and after almost an hour of looking on their website i found out that landlines also get charged by their local phone company.  This needs to be in bold and a lot more clear and visible.  i dont recommend this company.

This is a trustworthy network I would like to recommend to all Ghanaians in the US. So far, it is the cheapest means to call friends and relatives back home. Hope it remains an honest and affordable service provider!

                I used to buy phone cards for $10 and I would be given 45-50 mins. With rebtel, I get $10, but 60 mins. I get an extra 10 mins and I save on tax money by not going to the store to buy phone cards. Save mins, save tax money, and the trip to the store to buy the phone card. All you need is a debit or credit card, and purchase the card of your choice. My preference is the $10.

                I want to thank my friend, Dr. Luke for introducing me to Rebtel. I have always been apprehensive of this Internet subscription, but when my  friend who's very conservative told me to try it, I know it must be good. And I have not regretted joining in. It has afforded me the convenience of making calls whenever I want to make calls without going to look for where to buy calling cards. I recommend Rebtel to any skeptic such as myself. Rebtel is convenient and reliable.

                After signing up I soon found another service that offers cheaper rates. This is primarily due to certain host-carrier rates differing. In my case the number I was calling was on the Globe network, which is roughly 3 cents a minute cheaper than others. This is not reflected in Rebtel's listed rates. So.. I went from 15.9 cents/min to 12.5 by switching.

                intially your services were good when i started. later from second recharge, calls were not not connected and money was deducted. when ever calls were connected, the voice from receiver were not clear and receiver also was not able to hear me. To ensure, i try same number from same location to same receiver at same time from another service provider, and found that every thing was Good. This has beed repeated again and again with me at different time, and different dates and different receivers. So i feel that you make good impretion at initial stage, and once you feel that user is in your trap, you start cheating. This is modren world, i need to call and i wish to have best value for my money. you can take away what i had paid but sure you will loose me. May be i am a small fish for you, it is you and you have to present your self as what kind of service provider you are.

                So far, Rebtel has locked me out of my account on two occasions.  Both times, I was unable to use the service or even log in to my online account.  When this happens, you must email them and wait for a reply.  There is no customer service number, email is the only method of communication.  In both cases, I was locked out due to a specific number they claimed I called.  I was told that number was in a block of numbers that they claim have been perpetrators of fraud on their service.  I have never called the number they claimed I called.  Hopefully their automatic fraud detection system will improve, as it is obviously quite buggy.  I'm sure they could have handled this better as well.  Other than that, the price is right and I haven't noticed any issues with the call quality.  The unfortunate issue I mentioned though required I have a backup service on standby as I wait for them to unlock my account.

                Been using Rebtel since november, first weeks it was quite ok - but lately i experienced a drop in quality, they tried to fix it twice for me so I hope it will improve. Calling Sweden to Cambodia 6 cent/minute is nice if only the quality will be a litle better....

                Since the new update for Android I can't send international messages. The rebtel app puts in my country code before the number that I'm sending the SMS. There is no way round it because it doesn't give the opportunity to edit the number. Just an error message that the SMS can't be sent to that country (I'm sending to the UK). I've been in touch with Rebtel almost 1 1/2 weeks ago, and I've had no reply from them. Not happy with the new update and not happy with the customer service.

                Our cell phone provider wanted to charge us up to $2.99 a minute!  With a simple download of Rebtel on my iPhone, I now call my husband on his international cell phone for $.26 a minute!  You can't beat that!  Plus when I have little or not signal, I can call him via 3G/Internet!!  The connection is always great! Plus I can send SMS!  I have recommended this app to all of my army friends!!!

                So easy to sign up, deposit and use Rebtel. For the most part, connection is clear. If you call long distance, you'll find Rebtel convenient to use.

                The assignment of a local number is a great idea.  My area doesn't support avoiding long distance charges, but it makes it easy and simpler to dial an international number.  And if someone else sees the number, it hides the fact that it is international in case that matters.  Also, I don't feel as if I am calling so far away.  The Rebtel costs are reasonable or even lower that most.  I use Paypal to quickly add funds to my account.

                I have spent so much money with my iPhone, calling Nigeria and Ghana, Bahrain... I can't believe I waited so long to research other options.  Rebtel has allowed me to maintain contact with loved ones without breaking my bank and I can relax, so the call is much better.

                I stumbled upon this service very recently and pleasantly surprised by its ease of use and user friendliness. As a personal experience, i have been able to call my home country anytime and with a very respectful quality. I am now recommending the service to my friends abroad and do not hesitate using the share with friends feature to get more credit to call for free! Plus, they have just released an application for computer that ive been trying and works perfectly. Simple and handy, very rebtel!

                I signed up for Rebtel 3 years ago, when I moved to the Netherlands for my Master studies. As a student, you don't get much money to spend, so Rebtel was a great way to save on calls to my family.<br><br>After I was done with my studies, I got a job in London and moved there shortly after. And guess what? I could still use the same Rebtel account, with my saved contacts and history, with my new sim card.<br><br>The service is awesomely convenient! Easy to take with you to any country, easy to use and of course cheap to call wherever you need to call.<br><br>Highly recommended!<br><br>P.S. Android app is awesome. Highly recommended too!

                I moved recently to Malta and the money I spend on talking on a phone has increased. I happen to be a person who wants to talk with the family and friends back in Scandinavia when I feel like speaking to them, without planning a Skype date. The con with this is the high usage off pre paid to pup cards.. <br><br>My friend suggested me to try out Rebtel. I love it! I can call more often abroad without higher cost than doing local calls. My user experience has been generally very good and I can recommend it to the people who want to stay in touch with people living in another country. <br><br>Thank you Rebtel!!

                I decided to try Rebtel service mainly to see if it could help those friends and relatives who are non-techie, and it did. Some phone services have hi-fi methods/plans which may be tough to implement by the common man.<br><br>But Rebtel is simple, cheap and seems to be way better than conventional calling methods. Here the phone bell rings immediately as you dial the number, unlike other phone services which I have tried in this past. Though they charge a minimal price, yet the Call quality has been excellent so far.<br><br>After I got accustomed to this service and was satisfied about the same, I encouraged my loved ones to register with Rebtel. My family in abroad has been using this since a year and even my relatives and friends who are dispersed across the globe. All of them are thankful to me for recommending Rebtel.<br><br>The company offers you very reasonable international calls rates to various locations by assigning specific local phone numbers to your calls recipients in their countries. <br><br>Rebtel also offers you the benefit of several freebies. You can call your friend and ask him to hang up for some time, and call you back while you stay on the line. You'll be connected and you get the ‚Äòfree‚Äô call advantage of the international part. It may sound weird but trust me it works.<br><br>Also, you get a trial 5-minutes phone call to any number and not to forget all calls between Rebtel members are free. However, to enjoy this freebie, your friend may not necessary be a Rebtel subscriber at all but both of you must be living in one of the 51 Rebtel countries.

                For the next 36 months, my wife has been transferred to Manchester, UK. We have 2 kids, our son who is 8 years old and elder daughter who is 12 years old. Both the kids are very responsible and manage their activities on their own. We have tried several cheap international calling facilities, but none of them had good voice clarity, and surprisingly none of them turned out to be cheap as promised.<br><br>Our neighbours recommended Rebtel. They had a lot to say about Rebtel and its cheap international calling plans. They were quite convincing and we too tried Rebtel. As a starter we got 5 minutes of free calling and since it was Easter week the call rates were further low than their normal rates. Our kids love this service and believe me the voice clarity is very good. <br><br>Not to forget, Rebtel to Rebtel calling is free, so most of the times we are actually speaking free, unless we have to call some other number. Recently I got an e-newsletter from Rebtel, they serve more than 51 countries and every week they have some special offer.<br><br>Its good to know how technology can help you save money. Thank you Rebtel.<br><br>Pros - Cheap Rates, Good Service, Great Voice Clarity<br>Cons - Call drops on few occasions.

I make a call to someone and he says shall I call you back?

Not only that, even the quality of the each<br>call was way bad and the wait time for the ring was too long. The service would cause pain<br>rather than comfort.

                I use Rebtel to call two of my best friends who lives in Rio and Oslo. I use the Android app, and it's so easy to use you almost can't believe it. <br><br>When you dial an international number you get a question if you want to use Rebtel, you click yes, and the call is forwarded through Rebtel, that's it!<br><br>I was a bit hesitant to switch from Skype to Rebtel since the service looks a bit complicated on the home page. But I'm really happy that I decided to use Rebtel instead. I call from my own cell phone and pay almost nothing.<br><br>I think Rebtel would get a lot more customers if people really understood how easy the service is to use.

                I'm a single mother from Newyork and currently my son is doing research in South Africa. The cost of international calls is too high, because of which we barely spoke once in 10 days.<br><br>Few months back one of my son's colleagues suggested Rebtel to make cheap international calls. My son explained to me the concept of Rebtel which is based on internet telephony and why the calls made using Rebtel are cheap. Both of us have local Rebtel numbers on which we make a call, which gets internationally connected and that's how we speak to each other, every third day. And it is super easy to use. I don't have to worry about the bill s I can make payment through my credit card.<br><br>I would sincerely recommend their customer support for guiding me through the entire process. Since my son is always busy on field, I take help from Rebtel customer support. The support system is apt and easily understandable by someone like me who is not technology friendly. I have even suggested Rebtel to my sister living in downtown Chicago.<br><br>I just have one suggestion, please post me newsletters or other offers since I don't use the internet often.<br><br>Thank you Rebtel !!
